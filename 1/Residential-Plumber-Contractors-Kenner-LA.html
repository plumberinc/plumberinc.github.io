When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leakages. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can actually be the cheaper and much better long-lasting solution.</p>

Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
