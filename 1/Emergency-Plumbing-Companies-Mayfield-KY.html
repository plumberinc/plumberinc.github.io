Bio-Clean is an all-natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly reliable at getting rid of grime, waste, and organic product that so often blocks your drain lines.

<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
