<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. Because of the tight area, the pipes frequently make odd gurgling noises as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Blocked Trap: The toilet trap is located behind the bowl and formed like the letter S. In some cases, toys, bathroom tissue, paper towels and other debris get stuck in the trap and trigger a clog. Anti-jamming Systems - Most new waste disposal unit have built-in anti-jamming innovation which avoids clogs. Older models also have this functionality but need a special hex secret or Allen wrench that assists maximize jams.</p>
