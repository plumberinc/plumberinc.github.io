<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Menomonie WI</h3>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
