<p>Like many household appliances, your water heater is one of those things that gets considered given - until it goes kaput. Then it gathers all the attention it is worthy of. Usually, the life expectancy of many water heaters is in between ten and fifteen years. Of course, this life-span varies according to the frequency of use and care and maintenance.

You may have a concept of where your lateral is situated if you have actually had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the areas to avoid. Your line will be easy to determine if you have a clean-out.</p>

Installations must only be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
