<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally 2 layers of defense. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering into the structure, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the wrong method. There are two various types of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently defined-- a reduced pressure zone backflow device and a double check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on a certification test, I mention them just.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of security for the public supply of water system.</p>

One way to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to switch off all water appliances in your house and outdoors (sprinklers, hoses, and so on).

<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause difficult water. The system filters out these hard water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to stream through plumbing when water streams through a Water Softener. State certified backflow professionals, offered through your turf watering company or plumber can figure out whether your equipment fulfills the requirements. The guidelines also require a state certified backflow service technician test the backflow preventer each year.</p>
