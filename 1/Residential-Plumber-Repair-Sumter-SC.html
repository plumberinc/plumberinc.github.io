<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
