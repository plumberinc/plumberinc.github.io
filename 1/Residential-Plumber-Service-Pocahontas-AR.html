<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
