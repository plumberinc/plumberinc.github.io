<p>Hard water use might affect the efficiency of household home appliances. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A big scale buildup slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing components and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, thus impacting their performance.</p>
