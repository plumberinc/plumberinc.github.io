<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>If there is a leak, we will locate the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not already been finished. Then, our specialist will dig to find the gas line and leak. The gas line will be changed and pressure checked to ensure there are no leakages. The site will be tidied up and restored to its previous elegance if the leak is sufficiently fixed.</p>
