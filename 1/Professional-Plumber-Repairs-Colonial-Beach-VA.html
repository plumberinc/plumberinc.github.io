<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Regular drain inspections and cleanings are advised every 3 years or two. Appropriate maintenance is key to extending the life of your pipe system. Relying on drain cleaners bought at the shop can in fact hurt your pipes. This is why professional drain cleaning is recommended to ensure that your pipes are maintained using the most safe methods.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the brand-new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as specified in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
