The InSinkErator disposal series includes the Badger and Development series to supply a service for any commercial or residential need.</p>
<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance.

The thermal growth needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the expansion happening when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
