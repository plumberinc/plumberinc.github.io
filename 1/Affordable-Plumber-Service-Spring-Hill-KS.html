<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
