<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
