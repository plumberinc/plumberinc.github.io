To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, pour in equal parts of vinegar and baking soda on a regular basis. For regular cleaning, you'll simply need about one-half cup of each. Let the mixture sit for a few minutes before running some warm thin down the drain. You can also use lemon juice for the very same function.

<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Auburn ME 04210</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments include specialized camera equipment that runs into your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more tasty than trenching through the lawn if you have actually identified pooling water in the lawn. This will cost you (on average) in between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are granted to plumbers who have held a journey license for a particular quantity of time, and have actually collected the needed hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber also has to pass a state approved test.</p>
