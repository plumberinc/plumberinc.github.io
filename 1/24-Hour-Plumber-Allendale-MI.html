<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
