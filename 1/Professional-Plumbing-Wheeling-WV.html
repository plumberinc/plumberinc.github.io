New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It eliminates the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes good when you add a water softener.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
