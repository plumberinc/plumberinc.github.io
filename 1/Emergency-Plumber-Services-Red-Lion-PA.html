<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these issues, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or improper installation, often your waste disposal unit ends up being damaged by products that should not be run through it.</p>
<p>A license is also needed to reconnect electrical or gas service to a residence. Reconnect authorizations are required if the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months. The permit cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. If you are installing water or gas piping, a drawing needs to be submitted that determines the size and length of all piping.
