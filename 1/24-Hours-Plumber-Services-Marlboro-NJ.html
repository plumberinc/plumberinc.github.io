<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently.

We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leaks. We discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
