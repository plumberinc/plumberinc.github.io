<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
