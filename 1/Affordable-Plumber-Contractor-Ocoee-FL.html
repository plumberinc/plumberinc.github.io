<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many people choose diy repairs. But in some cases even recognizing the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
