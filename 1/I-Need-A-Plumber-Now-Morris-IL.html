<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Morris IL</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hoses: The extremely toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water system.</p>
