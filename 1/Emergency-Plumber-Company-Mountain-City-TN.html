<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions.

The majority of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that appear will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection website may affect the time it takes.
