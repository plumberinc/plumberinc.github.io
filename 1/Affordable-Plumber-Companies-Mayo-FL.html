<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
