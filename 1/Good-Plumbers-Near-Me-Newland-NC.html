Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Distribution pipes transition to even smaller sized specific service pipes, carrying water to individual houses, apartment or condo businesses, shops and buildings. Depending on need, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the customer facility by means of a water meter that records flow rates and water usage for billing functions. Private service pipelines are normally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be important.</p>
