<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from poor performance and premature failure.

Scale accumulation in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs. Quickly, these little expenses can add up to make a real impact on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Another way to handle a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they might be too severe on your pipes, you can try old home remedies like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda.
