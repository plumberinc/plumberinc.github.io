<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>We specialize in whole house re-pipes, brand-new plumbing installations, and mainline water service replacement. Whether you require help with a minor repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can make sure that the work will be finished the first time properly. Low water pressure could be due to a wide range of factors, but the most typical factors are sediment accumulation and corrosion, which both block water from travelling through the whole pipe and put unneeded pressure on specific areas of pipe.</p>
