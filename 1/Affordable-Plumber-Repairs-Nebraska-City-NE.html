For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to split and solidify or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in good shape.</p>
