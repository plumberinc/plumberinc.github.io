<p>The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer.

<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
