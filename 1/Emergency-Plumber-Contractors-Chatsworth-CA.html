<h3>How to Do Home Plumbing Inspection Yourself in Chatsworth CA 91311</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived throughout the appointed period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and recommended a tool to be used in the future. How do you know if it's time to require sewer line repair or replacement? Watch out for numerous clogged drains in your house, overflowing or supported toilets, or water spots on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Contact us for a price quote. Our experienced and certified plumbers will offer you with a truthful, upfront cost on the cost to install a toilet or repair ($ 29 or FREE if you choose us to repair or replace your toilet). House sinks go through a good deal of usage regularly. Your kitchen sink probably catches big quantities of food debris, consisting of oils and grease that can cause a clog. Likewise, hairs from shaving and other obstructions can congest the sink and render it inefficient for day-to-day usage.</p>
