<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure correct backflow prevention remains in place to safeguard our drinking water throughout the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing tip notice 30 days before the yearly test is due.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain.
