<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, however without the zinc finishing. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its task pretty well, over time, it still does rust. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
