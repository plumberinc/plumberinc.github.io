<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
