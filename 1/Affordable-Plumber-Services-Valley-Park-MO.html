<p>The Required Inspections Table revealed listed below lists those inspections that must be performed to confirm that your work complies with the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. Please note that Virginia's Building Code restricts using any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all required inspections. We hope this list is useful to you throughout the course of your job. Please call our Structure Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is needed for each inspection or if you need help scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Defense work require extra permits and inspections. Separate notifications are offered to describe the inspections required for each type of permit.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place more often than you believe! When you do not see the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Gas lines can be hazardous, and it's constantly best to tackle any problems with the help of a professional. Property owners should never attempt to fix a gas line on their own. One little error can cause a fire or a surge. There's no need to place everyone under your roof in threat and expose them to a potentially disastrous situation. Always work with the aid of an expert.</p>
