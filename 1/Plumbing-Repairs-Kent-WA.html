<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
