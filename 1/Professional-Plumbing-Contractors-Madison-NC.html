<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Madison NC</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>This may sound like a joke, however it's really major if you want to truly get the most out of your financial investment. Start by asking for a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.
