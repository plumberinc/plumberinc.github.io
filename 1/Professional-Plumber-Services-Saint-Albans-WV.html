<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Saint Albans WV</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
