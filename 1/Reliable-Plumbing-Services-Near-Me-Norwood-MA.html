<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and harden or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place.

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new area and put there.</p>
