<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
