<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>You may not recognize just how much you depend on your garbage disposal up until it quits working. If your disposal begins making loud noises or doesn't operate at all, it's time to call in a professional. Never ever put yourself at risk of injury by putting your hand in the drain. We have the training and tools to repair or replace the disposal properly. We'll detect the problem and quickly fix it so you can have a working disposal before your next meal.</p>
