<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl.

Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
