<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
