<h3>Drainage Pipe in Fairfield Pennsylvania</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another appointment. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
