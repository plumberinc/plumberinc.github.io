<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Section 106.2.2 shall be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping just. In structures besides Group R-3 occupancies, an authorization and inspection shall be needed for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor area, wing, or level is included, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (nominal) of the overall structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality. Call today at (979) 200-6674 to have your plumbing examined and we will let you understand if a repipe in Brenham is right for you.</p>
