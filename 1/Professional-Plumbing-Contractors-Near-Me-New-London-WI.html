Most people do not normally give much idea to their kitchen sinks, unless they are supporting or leaking. In fact, when redesigning a kitchen, the sink is typically the last factor to consider.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, steamfitters, and pipefitters must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating gradually from the within. In most cases, repiping is your only viable option.</p>
