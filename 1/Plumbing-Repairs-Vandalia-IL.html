<p>A Pilot burner That Has Gone Out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas hot water heater instead of a system with an electric heating aspect, there is a great chance your pilot light has actually headed out. This could be due to the fact that of an issue with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or simply a strong breeze. Despite what the concern is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to work till the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
