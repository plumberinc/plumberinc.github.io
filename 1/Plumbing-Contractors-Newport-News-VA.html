<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does occur regularly than you believe! Typically it takes place during the night when you don't see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow.
