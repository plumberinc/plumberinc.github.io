<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However finding the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are often readily available at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
