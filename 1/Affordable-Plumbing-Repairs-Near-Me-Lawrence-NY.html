<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Lawrence NY</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Lawrence NY 11559</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
