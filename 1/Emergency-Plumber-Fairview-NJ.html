<p>No homeowner wishes to deal with inefficient plumbing, specifically when it can cost thousands in repairs. Your houses plumbing goes beyond simply the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that connects to them. The majority of major plumbing problems generally happen on the main line, and it's best to prevent them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can result in bathrooms flooded with sewage, damaged pipes, and expensive repairs.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
