<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
