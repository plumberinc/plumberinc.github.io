<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A garbage disposal is a vital kitchen device in most homes today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can manage nearly any sort of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Used impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain clogs.</p>
