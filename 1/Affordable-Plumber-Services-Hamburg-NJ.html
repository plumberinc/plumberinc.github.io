For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
