<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Non-precipitating water softeners are now based on polymer type ingredients such as sodium polycarboxylate.
