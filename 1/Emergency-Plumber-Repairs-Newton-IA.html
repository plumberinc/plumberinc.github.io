<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
