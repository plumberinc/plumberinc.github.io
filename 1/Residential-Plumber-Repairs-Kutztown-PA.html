<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
