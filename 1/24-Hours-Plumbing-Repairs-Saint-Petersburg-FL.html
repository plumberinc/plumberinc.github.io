<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped suggestion helps force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>

New gas line expenses include device connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
