<p>These are all indications that your unit ought to be checked by a plumber. We do not advise attempting to repair this specific home appliance on your own, because it does present a security risk, due to the sharp blades that are used to grind and slice waste. You must also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit since these chemicals will only damage the appliance even more.</p>
<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
