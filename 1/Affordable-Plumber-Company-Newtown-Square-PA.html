It might be in need of significant repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life-span if your disposal is often making sounds that are unusual for the machine. Regular obstructions, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, could show a problem with the disposal. If there are leaks coming from your system, it is most likely due to too much use over a long period of time. Many of these leakages can be fixed, but if they end up being bigger and more regular, you must think about total system replacement.</p>
