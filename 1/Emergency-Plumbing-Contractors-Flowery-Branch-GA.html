<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Flowery Branch GA</h3>

Whether your current toilet needs repairs or you wish to install a more recent, more environmentally friendly toilet, our Fredericksburg, VA plumbers can help.

<p>Replacing your flapper may require a little different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
