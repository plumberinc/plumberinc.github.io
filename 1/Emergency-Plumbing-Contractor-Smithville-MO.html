<p>DCVs are specifically developed to prevent backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The pillar for regular fire protection applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 separately operating spring-loaded check valves (typically inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and go up depending upon size, brand and functions.</p>

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure changes and disc compression that might cause incorrect information on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that might damage components. The results of elevated temperature level can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the elements.

The new parts can quickly be made inoperative if parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>
