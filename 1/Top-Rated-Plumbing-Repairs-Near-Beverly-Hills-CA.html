<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Beverly Hills CA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their tasks break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (typically in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating additions and projects.</p>
