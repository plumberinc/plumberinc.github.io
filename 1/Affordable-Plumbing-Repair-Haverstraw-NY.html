<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
