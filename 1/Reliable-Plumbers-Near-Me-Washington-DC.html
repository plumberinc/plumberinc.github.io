<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, the majority of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation issues or even stop a fixture from streaming entirely.

A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
