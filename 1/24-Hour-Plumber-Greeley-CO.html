<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
