<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
