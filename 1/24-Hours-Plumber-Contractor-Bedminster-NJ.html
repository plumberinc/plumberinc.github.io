<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
