<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, permitting air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
