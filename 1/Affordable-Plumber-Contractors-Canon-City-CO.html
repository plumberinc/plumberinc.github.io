For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be set up and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electrical designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
