<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You may be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the exact same thing, but without the zinc covering. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, with time, it still does corrode. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to assist combat a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The need upstream might trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
