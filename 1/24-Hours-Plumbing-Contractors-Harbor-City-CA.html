<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more often than you believe! When you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
