<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that typically suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can occur in several locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
