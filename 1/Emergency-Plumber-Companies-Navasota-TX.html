<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Navasota TX</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If your problem is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation, it is essential to be mindful that many scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is caused by hard water. Difficult water usually leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become rather unattractive. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning techniques will certainly help, we highly recommend you look into setting up a water softener to assist with your difficult water.</p>
