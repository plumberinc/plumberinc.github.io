I just recently had numerous plumbing leaks fixed and could not be happier with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely suggest them to my family and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be credited to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance.
