<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Rossville GA</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select should be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
