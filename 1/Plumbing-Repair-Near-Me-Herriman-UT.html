For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
