<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Circleville OH 43113</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
