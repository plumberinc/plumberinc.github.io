Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
