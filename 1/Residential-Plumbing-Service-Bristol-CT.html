For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>No matter the kind of plumbing issue, addressing the issue early is crucial. However, capturing a gas leak prior to it becomes a larger issue is especially important.
