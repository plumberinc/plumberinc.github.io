<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater may need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While some of these problems can be credited to regular wear and tear or inappropriate installation, sometimes your garbage disposal ends up being harmed by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
