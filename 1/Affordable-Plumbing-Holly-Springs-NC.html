<p>Leaks are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from corrosion and may place toxins into the freshwater supply.
