For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
