<p>You might be questioning if it's time to replace the whole thing if you are having extreme issues with your toilet. There are only so many repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right? Well, there are a few things to take into consideration if you are weighing your alternatives between toilet repair and toilet replacement. In this week's blog, we will discuss a couple of questions to ask yourself when thinking about toilet repair or replacement.</p>
<h3>Laundry Room Plumbing in Laurel Delaware</h2>
<p>If you have a vintage look or a claw-foot tub, we have a number of imaginative options for you. Arrange an assessment with our Akron plumbers on the best drain for your specific tub.

<p>Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to suggestions that accompanies the images to make certain the connections are tight.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
