There are only so many repairs that you can make before you need a new toilet, right? Well, there are a few things to take into consideration if you are weighing your alternatives between toilet repair and toilet replacement.

<p>Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work.

<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical.

Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
