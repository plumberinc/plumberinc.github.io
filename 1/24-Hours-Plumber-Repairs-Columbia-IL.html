And that's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
