<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
