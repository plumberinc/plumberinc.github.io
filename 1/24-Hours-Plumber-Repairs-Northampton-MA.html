<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Northampton MA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into two classifications: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on renovating additions and jobs.</p>
