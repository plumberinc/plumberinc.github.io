<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Goddard KS 67052</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, without any indications of leakage, you can most likely leave it in location. Opportunities are great that the mounting brackets on the new unit will fit simply great. To learn, get rid of the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
