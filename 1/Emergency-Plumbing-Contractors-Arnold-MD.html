<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
