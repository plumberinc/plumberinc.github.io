<p>The easiest method to keep you and your family safe from the prospective risks of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have actually an authorized backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
