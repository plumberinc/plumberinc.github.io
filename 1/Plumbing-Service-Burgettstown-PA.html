<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That suggests you need to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw. However very first connect the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and check for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut up until you've done these final checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and get rid of if you find any problems.</p>
