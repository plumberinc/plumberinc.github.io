<p>Culpeper House Services provides professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will provide you with choices for repair or replacement and recommend the very best service depending upon your specific requirements. For double-bowl sinks, the very best way to set about things is to use a continuous waste disposer set including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
