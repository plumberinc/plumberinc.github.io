However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
