Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand name and functions.</p>
<p>Nothing is more frustrating than switching on a tap and noticing the water collect in the bottom of your sink or tub. Slow-draining or standing water is normally a sign of a clogged drain issue.
