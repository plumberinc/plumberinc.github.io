<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and depends on an excellent balance of water pressure in order to work effectively. If your showers become frustrating, or it appears little to no water is draining of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the house and the number of bathrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final expenses.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
