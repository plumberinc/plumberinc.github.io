We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-lasting service.</p>
