Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>

Each element can even more be broken down into its parts. For example a very first check is a component. A component can even more be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc).
