<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.

<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or long-term connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds.
