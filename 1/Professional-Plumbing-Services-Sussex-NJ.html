<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, ensure the drain compression seal is seated properly in the drain locknut, then tighten the drain and reinstall locknut. Lastly, turn on the water and test for leakages.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
