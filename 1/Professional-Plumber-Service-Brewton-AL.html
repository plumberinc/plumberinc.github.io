Trees and shrubs are a common reason for sewer obstructions to the house. Roots can turn into the smallest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient abundant environment supplied by the sewer.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your water heater is developed to draw in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from wearing away. The very best way to prevent drain blockages is to watch what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, discoloration, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting. Wearing away pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they haven't currently) and need to be changed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
