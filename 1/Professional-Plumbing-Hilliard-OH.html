<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Hilliard OH</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
