<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Hilliard OH</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
