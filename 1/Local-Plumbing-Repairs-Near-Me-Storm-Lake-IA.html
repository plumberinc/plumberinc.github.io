Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
