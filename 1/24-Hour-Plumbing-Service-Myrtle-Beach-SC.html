<p>The secret to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
