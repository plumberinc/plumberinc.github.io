<p>Diane Heether is a city citizen of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her house. It didn't just make and enhance cleaning easier, but it helps cut down on waste also.

<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
