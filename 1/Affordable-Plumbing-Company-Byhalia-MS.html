<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Byhalia MS 38611!</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
