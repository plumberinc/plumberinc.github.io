<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, heater, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these small deposits are harmless, however gradually they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply need backflow prevention assemblies to be set up on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and medical facilities, in addition to commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on damp or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
