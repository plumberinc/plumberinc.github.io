Throughout regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

The predetermined number represents the quantity of time in between each regeneration. For example, a lower chosen number means your softener will regenerate less often. If you are experiencing spots, attempt picking a lower number up until you discover one that satisfies your requirements. Demand-initiated softeners are more efficient and popular than time-initiated softeners.</p>
<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly caused since of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance.

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
