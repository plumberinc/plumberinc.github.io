You might have a leak someplace if you've been observing a moldy smell establishing in the cabinets under the sink. It might be the drain, the faucet, or even the supply hose. Because they are relatively easy to pinpoint, turn on the water and get sleuthing under your sink.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals.

<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
