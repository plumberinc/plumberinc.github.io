<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
