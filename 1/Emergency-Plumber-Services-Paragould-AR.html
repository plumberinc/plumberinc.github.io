When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
