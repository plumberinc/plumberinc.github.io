<p>Two styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health hazards but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were permitted to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In order to insure the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it needs to be evaluated and certified upon installation and at least when a year afterwards if set up to secure form a health threat situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers oversee these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear, or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked periodically to guarantee that they are operating appropriately. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be evaluated with properly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
