No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more often than you believe! Often it happens at night when you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems.
