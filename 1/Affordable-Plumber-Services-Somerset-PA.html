No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen more often than you believe! Often it happens at night when you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
