<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
