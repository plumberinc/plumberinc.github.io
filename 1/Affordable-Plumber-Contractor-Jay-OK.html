<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and harden or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
