<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Tankless electric hot water heater can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are large and effective enough to provide warm water to all bathrooms, kitchen areas, and appliances in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that supply warm water to particular spaces or home appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the very same way. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any offered time. Likewise, whole-house units are considerably more costly than the point of usage systems.</p>
