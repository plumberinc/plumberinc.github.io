<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you utilize a gas water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating element, there is a good chance your pilot light has actually headed out. This might be because of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or just a strong breeze. Despite what the problem is, nevertheless, your water heater will not be able to operate until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home. Generally, the water supply to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>

Most plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that crop up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site might affect the time it takes.
