<h3>Reverse Osmosis Installation in Fayetteville North Carolina</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with hair, debris, or toilet paper? After years of usage, drains can collect harmful accumulation. This accumulation blocks water flow, eventually backing up your drains till they are unusable. Usually, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing. We can achieve this through a variety of techniques such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
