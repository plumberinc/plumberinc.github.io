<p>In water supply systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).
