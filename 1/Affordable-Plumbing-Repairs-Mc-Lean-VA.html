<p>When you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it.
