There's likely a larger problem of blockage in the drain or sewer-line if this is a common incident. Our plumbers can help you to eliminate the problem and determine-- quickly.</p>
<p>Unless you have a wily two-year old who loves to throw bathroom tissue down the toilet, you ought to not have regular clogging concerns. In fact, you should seldom have a clogged toilet if you are using it appropriately and if it is operating properly.
