<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
