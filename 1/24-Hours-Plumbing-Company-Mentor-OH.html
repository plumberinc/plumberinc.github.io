We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs need the parts to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each part is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the correct area. It is likewise crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is attached on the elements or inadvertently put in the body. The components need to be put so that the guides are able to maintain their created tolerances.</p>
