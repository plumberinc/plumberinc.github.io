Your homes plumbing exceeds simply the pipes inside your home to the main sewer line that connects to them. A lot of significant plumbing problems generally take place on the main line, and it's best to prevent them as much as possible. Damaged sewer lines can result in restrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and costly repairs.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs may remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
