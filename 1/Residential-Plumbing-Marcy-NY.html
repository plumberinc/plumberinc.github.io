<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that must also be well preserved to help prevent leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space along with it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the place.

We highly suggest likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

If you have kids, you might not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
