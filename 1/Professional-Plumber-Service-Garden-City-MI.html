This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
