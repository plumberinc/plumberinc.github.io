<p>2. Demand-initiated softeners regenerate when they notice their softening capacity is low as identified by a preset number entered by the user.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Her expense lists a trip charge of $98. The waste disposal unit plus labor totaled $660.64. There's an $85.83 charge for somebody to bring the disposal to the service technician and a $12 environmental protection cost.

They get here on time, patiently attend to all questions, and go the extra mile to maintain customer complete satisfaction.
