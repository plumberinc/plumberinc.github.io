<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
