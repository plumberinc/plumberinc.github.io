<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Covington TN 38019</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
