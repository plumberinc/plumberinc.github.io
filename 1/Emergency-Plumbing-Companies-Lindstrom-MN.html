<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Lindstrom MN 55045</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
