<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Flower Mound TX</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
