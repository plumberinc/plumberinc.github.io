When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>As a company owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating impact on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more wear and tear than residential drains and are more prone to blockages and clog.
