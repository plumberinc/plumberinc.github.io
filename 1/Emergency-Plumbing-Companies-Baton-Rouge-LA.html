Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
