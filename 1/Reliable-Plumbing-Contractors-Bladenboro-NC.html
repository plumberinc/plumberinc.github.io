<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your residential or commercial property. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street.

<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Bladenboro NC</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
