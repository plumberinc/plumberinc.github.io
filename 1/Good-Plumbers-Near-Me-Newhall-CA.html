However, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
