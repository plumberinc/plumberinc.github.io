<p>Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
