<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
