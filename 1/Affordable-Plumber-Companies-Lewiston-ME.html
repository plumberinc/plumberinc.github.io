<p>The usual option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
