<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they likewise supply the least amount of defense. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
