<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each component. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
