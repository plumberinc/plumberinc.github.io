<p>Making sure plumbing equipment such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is necessary in order to maintain potable water safety. Having a plumbing inspection is pretty basic when purchasing a home or flat. , if it's a rental I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.. Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be one of the most costly repair projects if overlooked. For instance, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is an issue, you may need all of your water piping changed. Once again, very pricey. This is simply one of lots of concerns that can turn up.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but with time they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
