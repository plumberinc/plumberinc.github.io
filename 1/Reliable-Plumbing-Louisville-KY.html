<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house.

Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
