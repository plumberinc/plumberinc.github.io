We now have cleaned up and examined the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some designs need the elements to be eliminated in a specific order. These assemblies will also require the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each component is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the appropriate area. It is likewise essential that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the parts or unintentionally positioned in the body. The parts should be placed so that the guides have the ability to preserve their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
