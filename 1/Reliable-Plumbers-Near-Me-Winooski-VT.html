<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is known as fouling. In some cases it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker directions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the salt water service into the softener tank and the ion exchange process takes place again, only this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.
