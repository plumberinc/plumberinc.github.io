These materials gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them difficult to get rid of. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most typical signs that your system is at completion of its life expectancy, especially if they are causing significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
