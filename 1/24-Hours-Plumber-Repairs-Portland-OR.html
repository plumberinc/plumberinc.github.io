<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some softeners deal with electricity, but some more current water softeners use waterpower.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
