<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, commonly called "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to obtain consistency among the different jurisdictions within the State; reduce the building's energy and water use; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can often get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
