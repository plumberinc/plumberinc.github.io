<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can create sound. If your energy bills are rising, a new, greater efficiency hot water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its brand-new location and put there.</p>
