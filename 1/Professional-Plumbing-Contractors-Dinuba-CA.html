<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Dinuba CA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the help of a professional. Some small blockages can be taken care of with a plunger and frequently, when the toilet will not stop running, it's an easy matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, specific concerns do call for an experienced plumber, and it is very important to understand the distinction to avoid wasted time, frustration, and money.</p>
