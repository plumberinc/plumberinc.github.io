<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it might wreak unwelcome concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street.

<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Middlefield OH</h3>
<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Luckily this is a relatively affordable plumbing repair, and can help extend the life of your warm water heater. Fill up the sink with water and touch a facial tissue in between the bottom of the kitchen sink drain and the sink. If the tissue picks up any water, you've got a leaky basket strainer and it's time to learn how to remove a sink drain.

And when you need new gas lines set up, there is only one company to call in Western Michigan - Service Professor.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel eventually suffers from rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
