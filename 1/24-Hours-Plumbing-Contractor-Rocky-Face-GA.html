<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention choices, but they also supply the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc rises and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
