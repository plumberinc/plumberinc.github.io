<p>When compared to gas designs, electric designs are easier and less costly to install as electrical power is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be ventilated effectively utilizing vents and ducts in order to operate correctly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
