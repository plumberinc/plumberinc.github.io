<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services El Campo TX</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Call your local gas utility company right away if a natural gas line is damaged when digging outside of the home. Eliminate the drain basket and encircle the sink hole with a coil of plumber.
