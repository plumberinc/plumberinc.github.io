<p>A freshly set up hot water heater need to not produce odd sounds, but it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen considerably for families with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
