<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Bennington NE</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
