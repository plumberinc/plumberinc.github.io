<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically known as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the structure's energy and water usage; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Need loads, no matter what their usage, must be met by a sufficiently sized water system, which makes up the second major component of a water system system. With adequate tank capacity to satisfy variable peak load need, the water supply source can provide a steady flow of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be used to refill storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then offer water for emergency usage and periods when demand exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take numerous types, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, man-made or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
