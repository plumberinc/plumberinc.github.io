<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services New Berlin WI</h3>
<p>Weird Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to travel through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual noises emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
