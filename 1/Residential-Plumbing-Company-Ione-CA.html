Because of the tight space, the pipes typically make strange gurgling noises as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, leading to the strange sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Blocked Trap: The toilet trap lies behind the bowl and shaped like the letter S. Sometimes, toys, toilet paper, paper towels and other particles get stuck in the trap and trigger a clog. Anti-jamming Units - Most new garbage disposals have integrated anti-jamming technology which avoids clogs. Older designs also have this functionality however require a special hex secret or Allen wrench that helps free up jams.</p>
