Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it.

As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
