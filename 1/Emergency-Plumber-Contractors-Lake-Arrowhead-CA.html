Remove it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will switch off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue.
