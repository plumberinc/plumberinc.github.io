<p>2 styles of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB might be utilized to separate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
