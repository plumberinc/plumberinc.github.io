<p>Demand loads, no matter what their use, need to be fulfilled by an effectively sized water system, which constitutes the 2nd major part of a water supply system. With sufficient tank capability to meet variable peak load need, the water supply source can offer a steady flow of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be used to refill storage cisterns, towers and tanks, which then offer water for emergency usage and periods when need goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A water supply source can take numerous kinds, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals.
