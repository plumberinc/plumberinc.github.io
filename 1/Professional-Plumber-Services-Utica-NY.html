<p>You see rust in your water: If you start to notice rust in your water, it could be a sign that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust frequently permeates into the water system when pipes have become corroded. Although rust isn't naturally hazardous for your health, it can be a sign of problem to come. If you purchase a replacement that's made by the very same maker as your old model, you might be able to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and mounting flange in the sink, considerably simplifying the task (it can be a bigger, more powerful unit-- it just needs to have the exact same installing flange).</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include device wires connected, and others do not. Eliminate the cover plate underneath the disposal and attach the wires according the maker's guidelines if yours does not.
