<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi).

<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that wear away with time, leading to leaks or other problems. Additionally, rust or other buildups in the pipes can restrict air flow and make it impossible to utilize several of your gas-powered appliances like the clothes dryer or stove.

There are also several tools and materials included which you might not have. The process should be technically precise, and it is suggested to avoid mishaps by utilizing the services of a professional.</p>

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to go into the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
