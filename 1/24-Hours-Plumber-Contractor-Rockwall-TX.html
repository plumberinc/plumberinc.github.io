Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
