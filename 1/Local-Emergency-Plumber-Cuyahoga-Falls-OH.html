<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs.

Compare their costs with what you can discover online or at home enhancement stores if you need a brand-new sink or faucet. They may be getting you a much better offer</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
