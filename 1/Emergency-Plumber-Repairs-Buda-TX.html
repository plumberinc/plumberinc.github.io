<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as the majority of plumbers do, to use disposals moderately. Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
