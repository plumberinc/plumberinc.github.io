<p>We've already seen what these two terms share, so what's the distinction between them? When it concerns the issue of tough water, a standard water softener in fact removes calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is called short-term hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency South Plainfield NJ</h3>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. Sometimes it might be required to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin becomes fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
