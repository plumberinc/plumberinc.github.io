<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
