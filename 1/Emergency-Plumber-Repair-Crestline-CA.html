<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Main sewer repair includes substantial excavation, shoring up supporting walls, relaying and getting rid of pipe and connections, backfilling, and setting up plates for momentary cover. Service lines which stem from personal property and feed into the main line are a common area for breaks or leakages.
