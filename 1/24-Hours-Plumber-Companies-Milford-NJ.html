Chances are good that the mounting brackets on the new system will fit simply fine. To find out, eliminate the old disposal and install the new flange on it. You can install the new disposal utilizing the old flange if it fits.</p>
<p>Our kitchen and bathroom sinks are something we consider approved till they begin acting up. And it just so takes place that our kitchen and bathroom sinks start breaking down at the most bothersome times, like when we're having more than supper visitors, or when we're running late for work in the early morning.
