<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Know that most types of disposals need a switch adjacent to the sink to manage the outlet-- the electrician must wire for this, too. Note: Batch-feed disposers don't need a switch because they start when you place and turn an unique drain plug. The purpose of the plumbing code is to insure the correct installation of systems for providing drinkable water, for sanitary sewage disposal and storm drainage; and to guarantee public safety, health, and well-being insofar as affected by the installation of plumbing.</p>
