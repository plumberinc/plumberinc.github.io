<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that the average backflow occurrence takes nearly 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever questioned just what is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. But water softeners were produced to combat a remarkably typical issue: difficult water.</p>
<p>House owners typically forego maintenance and take care of their garbage disposal. We simply expect this workhorse located under the sink to operate as meant when we need it.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>Discharge piping linked to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve.
