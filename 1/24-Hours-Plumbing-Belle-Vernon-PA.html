<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It collects solidity minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are frequently used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The outcome of our advanced water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still preserving an efficient circulation rate.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complex scientific procedure, but easy to correct. It uses salt to remove minerals and smells discovered in difficult water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that draw in and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
