A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
