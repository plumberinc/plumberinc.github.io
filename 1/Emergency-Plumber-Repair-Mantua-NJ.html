<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
