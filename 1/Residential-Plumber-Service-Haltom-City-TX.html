While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment.

That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.
