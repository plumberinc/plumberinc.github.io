<p>It is important that the unit and garbage disposal plumbing are in great working order to avoid kitchen drain obstructions or backups if you have a garbage disposal.

Garbage disposal obstructions can be brought on by food items like fats or grease, bones, or highly fibrous foods like celery.</p>

These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
