<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
