<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers need to be able to raise and move heavy tools and products. Pointer: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the within. In many cases, repiping is your only viable alternative.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with new rubber parts.
