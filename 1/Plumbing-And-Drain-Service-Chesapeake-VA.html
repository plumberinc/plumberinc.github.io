Generally, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as effectively eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
