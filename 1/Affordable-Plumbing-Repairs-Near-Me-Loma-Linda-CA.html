<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
