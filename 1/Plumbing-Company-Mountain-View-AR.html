<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Mountain View AR</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Blocked Trap: The toilet trap lies behind the bowl and formed like the letter S. In some cases, toys, toilet tissue, paper towels and other debris get stuck in the trap and cause a clog. Anti-jamming Systems - The majority of brand-new garbage disposals have built-in anti-jamming technology which prevents blockages. Older designs also have this functionality but need a special hex key or Allen wrench that helps maximize jams.</p>
