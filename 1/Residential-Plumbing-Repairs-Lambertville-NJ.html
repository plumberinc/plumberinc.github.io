<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
<p>Many backflow preventers are created to permit the components to be removed for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not required for the most part. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
