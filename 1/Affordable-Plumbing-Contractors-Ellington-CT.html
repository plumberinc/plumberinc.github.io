<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Ellington CT 06029</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
