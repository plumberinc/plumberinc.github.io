<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in El Reno OK 73036</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>Pro Tip: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
