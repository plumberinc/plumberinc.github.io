<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The water heater tank need to have some room to represent the growth that happens when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
