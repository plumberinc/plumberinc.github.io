<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

<p>When you've found the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you've protected the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
