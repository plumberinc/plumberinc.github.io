<p>A Pilot Light That Has Actually Gone Out: If you are not getting any hot water at all, and you use a gas water heater rather than a system with an electrical heating component, there is a great chance your pilot burner has gone out. This could be since of a problem with your thermocouple, a lack of combustible air, or merely a strong breeze. Despite what the problem is, however, your hot water heater will not have the ability to operate till the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
