Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of protection for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be gotten rid of. Backflow assemblies are needed to be installed on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape lawn sprinkler. The law likewise needs backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and health centers, as well as commercial centers.</p>
