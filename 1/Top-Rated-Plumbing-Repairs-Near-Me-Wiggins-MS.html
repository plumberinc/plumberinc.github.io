<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions determined water service providers to implement water conservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in homes were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant obstructions: If the plunger has actually ended up being a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant blockages suggest your toilet no longer has the power needed to successfully eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
