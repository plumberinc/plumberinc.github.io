<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any variety of aspects which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force exerted by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to crack and start leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
