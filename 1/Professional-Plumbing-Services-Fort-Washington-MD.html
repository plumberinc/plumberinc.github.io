<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen regularly than you think! Typically it happens in the evening when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
