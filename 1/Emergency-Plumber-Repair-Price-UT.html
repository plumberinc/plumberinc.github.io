<p>Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a building these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
