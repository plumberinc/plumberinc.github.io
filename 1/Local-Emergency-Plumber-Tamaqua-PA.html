We had been on trip throughout the time of repair and it was soothing to understand it had been taken care of and prepared to go upon our return.

For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
