Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does happen more often than you believe! Frequently it happens at night when you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes.

Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated.

Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is needed to ensure it was fixed effectively. A properly repaired assembly must offer years of defense.</p>
