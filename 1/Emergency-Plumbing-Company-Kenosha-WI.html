<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to drains.

If your energy costs are increasing, a brand-new, higher performance hot water heater can bring them back down.
