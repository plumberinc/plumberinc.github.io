The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
