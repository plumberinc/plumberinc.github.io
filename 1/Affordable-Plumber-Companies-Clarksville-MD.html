In many cases, the property owner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most of plumbing problems are easy for a professional to fix when they are caught in a prompt style. Make a visit to have a plumber diagnose the problem if you are experiencing any of the above symptoms in your household. The faster you fix plumbing problems, the more economical the repairs.
