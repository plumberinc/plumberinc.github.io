<p>A lot of need for plumbers will come from brand-new building and construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing homes and other buildings. Employment of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to building codes that require the use of fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal attached to the sink already, it's likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. A lot of drains are connected to the sink by a large nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
