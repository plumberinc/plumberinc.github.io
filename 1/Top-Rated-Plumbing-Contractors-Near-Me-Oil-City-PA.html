<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in difficult water can cause a bad odor and taste. It removes the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great when you include a water softener.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be better with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely well-informed, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely suggest them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
<p>While fixing your hot water heater is typically the less expensive option to make, it isn't constantly the ideal one depending upon your situation. When you work with Kramer and Sons to work on your hot water heater, our skilled service technicians will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of replacement vs repair. However, there's still some research you can do before we show up to help speed up the process.</p>
<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
