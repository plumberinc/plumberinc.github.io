<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
