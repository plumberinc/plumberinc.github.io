<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>No other room in a house contains as lots of pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. We now have cleaned up and inspected the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now ready to begin the re-assembly process. Some models need the elements to be eliminated in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is necessary to put them back in the right place. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the parts or unintentionally put in the body. The elements must be placed so that the guides have the ability to keep their created tolerances.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device permits water to press the check valves open when water is entering the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are 2 different kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are typically specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. I mention them only because they will be on an accreditation test.</p>

<p>We need to clarify a little terms before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut off, properly situated test cocks, and the needed components of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet). Each part can even more be broken down into its parts. For instance a very first check is a component. A component can further be broken down into its private parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are assembled to make parts, and parts are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
