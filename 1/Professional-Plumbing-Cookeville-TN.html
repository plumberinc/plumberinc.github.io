<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Cookeville Tennessee</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with toilet, particles, or hair paper? After years of use, drains can collect destructive accumulation.

We can accomplish this through a range of methods such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
