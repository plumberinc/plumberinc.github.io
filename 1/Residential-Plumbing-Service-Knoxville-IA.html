An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>As we said, a garbage disposal has a life-span. Generally they will last between ten and twelve years. So, if you observe any of the following signs when you have had your disposal for about this amount of time, then you are right about all set for a new one.
