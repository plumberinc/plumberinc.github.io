<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
