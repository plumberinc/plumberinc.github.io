As hard water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can produce noise. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher performance hot water heater can bring them pull back. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, allowing difficult water to flow to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new location and positioned there.</p>
