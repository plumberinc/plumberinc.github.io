Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>

The outcome of our advanced water softener innovation is healthier, smoother water for you and your family, while still maintaining an efficient circulation rate.</p>
