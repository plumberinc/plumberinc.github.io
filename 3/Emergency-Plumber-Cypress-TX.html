<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as outlined listed below. Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Worn impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the risk of drain blockages.</p>
