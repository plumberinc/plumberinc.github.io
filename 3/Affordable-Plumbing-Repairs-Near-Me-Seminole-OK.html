<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals found in water. Generally, minerals arrive since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it remains in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>
<p>We need to clarify a little terminology before we proceed with a backflow prevention assembly repair. A backflow prevention assembly consists of an inlet and outlet shut off, properly located test cocks, and the required parts of the assembly (check valves, relief valve or air inlet).

A component can further be broken down into its individual parts (check discs, springs, disc holder etc). Backflow parts are put together to make parts, and components are put together to make a backflow prevention assembly.</p>
