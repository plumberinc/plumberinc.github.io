<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Villas NJ</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Usually, minerals get there since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it remains in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as successfully gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes tough water.</p>
