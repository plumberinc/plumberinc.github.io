<p>Once you've found the trip lever you want, all you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
