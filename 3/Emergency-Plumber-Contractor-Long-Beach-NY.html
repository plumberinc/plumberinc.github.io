<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
