<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should also be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or just be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>
