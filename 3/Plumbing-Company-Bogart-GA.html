<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
