<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Local or state federal government usually implements backflow prevention. Consult your local jurisdiction on backflow prevention requirement and gadgets. In a watering system, backflow has two causes: back siphonage or back pressure.

Leave the facilities instantly then call 911 and Atmos Energy at 866-322-8667. Do not depend on your sense of smell alone to identify the existence of natural gas. Use all of your senses-- smell, listen or look-- to check for indications of a leak.</p>
