For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
