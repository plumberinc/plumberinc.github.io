In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous clogs: If the plunger has become a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant obstructions suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to efficiently eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
