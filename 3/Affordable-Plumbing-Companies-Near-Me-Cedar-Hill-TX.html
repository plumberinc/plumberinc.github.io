Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
