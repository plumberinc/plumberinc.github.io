<p>You can unwind and utilize your gas piping without any concern when we handle your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
