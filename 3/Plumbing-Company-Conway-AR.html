<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

If you do have regular leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-lasting option.</p>
