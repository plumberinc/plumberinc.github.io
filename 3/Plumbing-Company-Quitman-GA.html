<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
