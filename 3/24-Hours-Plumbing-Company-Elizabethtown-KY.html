<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Elizabethtown KY 42701</h3>
<p>These valves have a great deal of flexibility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention choices, however they also provide the least amount of defense. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really knowledgeable, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely recommend them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
