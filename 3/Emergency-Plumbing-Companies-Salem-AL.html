<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat various actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but possibilities are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
