<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that must also be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever is in great shape.</p>

Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; obtain the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
