<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
