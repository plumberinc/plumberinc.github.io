Plumbers usually charge $45 to $65 an hour and can generally install a hot water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Cover the flapper valve with your hand. Switch on the water (very carefully, so you don't get a cold shower!) and let it flush out the toilet valve for a few seconds.
