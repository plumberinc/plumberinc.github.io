<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Ottawa IL</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
