<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
