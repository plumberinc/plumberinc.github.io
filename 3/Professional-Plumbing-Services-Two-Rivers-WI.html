<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Two Rivers WI</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
