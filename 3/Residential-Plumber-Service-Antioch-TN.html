<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Antioch TN 37013</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
