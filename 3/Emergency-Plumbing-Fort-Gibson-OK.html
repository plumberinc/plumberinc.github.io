Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<h3>Reverse Osmosis Installation in Fort Gibson Oklahoma</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates short-term hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant restrictions of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
