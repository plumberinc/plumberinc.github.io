<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping).

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, in addition to examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
