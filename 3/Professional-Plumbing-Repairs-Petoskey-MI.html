When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
