<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

Difficult water generally leaves lime and calcium buildup which can become quite undesirable.
