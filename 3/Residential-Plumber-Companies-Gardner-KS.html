The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
