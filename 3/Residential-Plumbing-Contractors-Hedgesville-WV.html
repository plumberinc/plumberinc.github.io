<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Hedgesville WV 25427</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
