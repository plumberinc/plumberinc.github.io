It is suggested that you enable your system to go empty of one kind of salt before adding another to avoid the incident of any problems.

And ensure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Some homeowners may think of water softeners as a high-end product, something that's nice to have" but not entirely necessary. However, tough water can cause everything from minor inconveniences, like spots on meals or soap residue, to major problems like a much shorter life expectancy for your hot water heater, dishwasher, and other important house appliances.
