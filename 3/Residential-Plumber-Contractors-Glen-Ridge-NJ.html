If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, and even go into and break the line. If you are hiring somebody to plant for you, make sure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to prevent. Your line will be easy to determine if you have a clean-out.</p>
