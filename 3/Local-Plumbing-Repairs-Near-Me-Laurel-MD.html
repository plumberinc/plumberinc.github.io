Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, in addition to examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
