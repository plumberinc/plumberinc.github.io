<p>Never attempt a repair or garbage disposal installation on your own. Always trust a professional to decrease the opportunities of injury. Your house is over ten years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from merchants or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can discover online or in the house enhancement stores. They might be getting you a much better deal</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
