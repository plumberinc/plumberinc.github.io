We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leakages. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and much better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
