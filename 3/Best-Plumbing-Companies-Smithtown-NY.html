When the day comes that it stops working, this way you will not have a surprise expenditure on your hands.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
