<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
