<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Great Neck New York</h2>
<p>If you're coping with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless device repair expenses, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not a problem that will disappear on its own and the expenses incurred by hard water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, appliances will inevitably stop working earlier than their expected life expectancy. If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your home. Tough water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. The perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue up until your house is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>

They typically consist of an inlet shutoff valve, 2 spring-loaded check valves separated by a pressure differential relief valve, 4 test cocks, and an outlet shutoff valve.
