<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Granby CT</h3>
<p>Whether you need electrical, natural gas, or tankless hot water heater, we have the right one for your house. The most standard and popular style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's neighborhoods is a gas or electric storage tank system. These systems keep just the correct amount of hot water for your convenience. If you are looking to save more energy and lower your water costs, a tankless hot water heater would be best because it just warms water, as you use it not when you don't.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
