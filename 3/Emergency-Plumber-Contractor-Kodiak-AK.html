<p>In water supply systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more prone and fragile to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other products are vulnerable to rust and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as an outcome of temperature change and ice development. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>

These features are a matter of personal choice. So watch out for sales people who attempt to offer you on their product's capability to outlive or "outsoften" other items. The majority of water softeners are hardware on which you can rely.</p>
