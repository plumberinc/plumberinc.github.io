<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
