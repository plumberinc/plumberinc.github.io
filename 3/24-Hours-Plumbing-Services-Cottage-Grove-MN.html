<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse circulation testing developed to ensure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a genuine health issue, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
