<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, without any indications of leak, you can most likely leave it in location. Opportunities are excellent that the installing brackets on the brand-new unit will fit just great. To discover, remove the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal utilizing the old flange.</p>
