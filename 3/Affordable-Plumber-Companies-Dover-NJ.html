<p>As soon as you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire, all you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
