The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to warm the water. Things intensify dramatically for families with a high demand for warm water.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
