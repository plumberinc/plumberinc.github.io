<p>Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system.

<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Missoula MT 59801</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
<p>These are all indications that your system must be checked by a plumber.
