One typical way for a home's water supply to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>As soon as a large adequate source of water has been recognized and evaluated, the 3rd significant component of a supply of water system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers. The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. A lot of large cities need several aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
