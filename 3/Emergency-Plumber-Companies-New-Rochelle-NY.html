Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.

Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience minimal disturbance to your day-to-day regimen. To begin the repiping procedure, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furnishings to safeguard them from dust and debris.
