<p>Commercial sink plumbing is more complicated than residential bathroom or kitchen sink plumbing.

<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can create noise. If your energy expenses are increasing, a new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting hard water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its brand-new place and positioned there.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
