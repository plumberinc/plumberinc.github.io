<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Bristol PA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
