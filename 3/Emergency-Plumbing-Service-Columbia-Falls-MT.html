They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It should also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
