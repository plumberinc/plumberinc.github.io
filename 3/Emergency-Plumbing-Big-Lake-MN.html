<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
