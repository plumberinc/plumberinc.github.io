<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and hot water heater repair from physical damage such as leaks or fractures are also common incidents. Kenny came out and did an extraordinary job unclogging my storm drain. He identified the problem and had the ability to return and jet it out.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
