<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
