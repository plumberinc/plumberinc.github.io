<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such possible health threats are disconcerting, but they aren't the only problem. Backflow can also be exceptionally expensive to remediate. The Epa (EPA) mentions that the average backflow event takes almost 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever wondered exactly what is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were produced to fight a surprisingly common problem: tough water.</p>
<p>Market prices for home water softeners might vary from roughly $400 to $2,700, depending upon the size and kind of softener. Softeners are ranked by the total number of grains the system can eliminate before being charged. The cost of salt is around $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the kind purchased, and up to $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>

<p>Lots of house owners will see a clog and immediately reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical might finish the job, it's in fact quite destructive to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners typically utilize lye as the active ingredient. Lye is created to penetrate clogs and dissolve them, however it also penetrates your pipes and creates weak spots that are prone to burst.</p>
