<p>No other room in a house consists of as many pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. When changing an under-sink assembly, look for quality products. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, along with flexible rubber traps. Debris can easily capture in this kind of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not supply needed assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be quickly attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets before testing the drain.</p>
<p>A permit is also required to reconnect electric or gas service to a home. If the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect authorizations are needed. The license cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection costs.
