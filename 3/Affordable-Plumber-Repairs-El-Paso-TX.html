<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors El Paso TX</h3>
<p>Whether you need electric, gas, or tankless hot water heater, we have the ideal one for your house. The most popular and traditional style of hot water heater in Boston and surrounding Massachusetts's communities is a gas or electrical storage tank system. These systems save just the right amount of warm water for your benefit. A tankless water heater would be best if you are looking to save more energy and lower your water costs due to the fact that it only heats up water, as you use it not when you do not.</p>
<p>This article aims to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that typically lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
