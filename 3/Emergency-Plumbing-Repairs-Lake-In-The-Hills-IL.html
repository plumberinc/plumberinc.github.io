<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lake In The Hills IL</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Usually, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues travel with the water up until it is in your home. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as successfully removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers tough water.</p>
<p>This post intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few complicated realities that typically lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
