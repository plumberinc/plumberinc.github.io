<p>The cost of the repair. The general guideline is that if the repair task will cost at least half as much as a brand-new unit, then you must replace it.

But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured.

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Spencer IN 47460</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
