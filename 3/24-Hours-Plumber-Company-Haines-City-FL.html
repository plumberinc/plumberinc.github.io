<p>Odd Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to go through. The pipes typically make odd gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the odd sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined spaces. The best method to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive area and need a large swing angle, which might be difficult to get in small spaces.</p>
