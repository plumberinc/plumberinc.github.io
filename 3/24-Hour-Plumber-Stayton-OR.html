<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers must have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and products. Pointer: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and remove the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are deteriorating slowly from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
