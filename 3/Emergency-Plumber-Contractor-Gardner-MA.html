<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
