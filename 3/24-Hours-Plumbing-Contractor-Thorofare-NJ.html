The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
