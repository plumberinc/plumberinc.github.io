<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Killeen TX 76549</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
