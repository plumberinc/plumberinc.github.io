<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are incredibly crucial to constructing a track record for excellence. Note: The disposer outlet must be above the drain line coming out of the wall.

If however, you start smelling something nasty coming out of your drains or around your house, there might be a crack somewhere in your sewer line.</p>
