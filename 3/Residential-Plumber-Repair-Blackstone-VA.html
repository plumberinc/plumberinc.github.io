This is especially real if you have unattended difficult water, which contains extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is hard to repair. Leaks typically indicate a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>That stated, you don't always need to drain tens of countless dollars on fixing your home's pipe or sewer lines.
