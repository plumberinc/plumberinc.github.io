<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment.
