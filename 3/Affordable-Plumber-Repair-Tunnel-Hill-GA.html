<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Tunnel Hill GA 30755</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal installation needs to be performed by a professional plumber if you want it to work well for many years to come. It is a reasonably basic device that sucks food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. When they are small enough, they travel through to the remainder of the wastewater to be dealt with. It generally uses up your kitchen sink drain but can be installed on just one side if you have a battle drain setup.</p>
