<p>Pools of septic waste. Among the more obvious outdoor indications is if you can see sewage pooling in your backyard. The issue could be a cracked main sewer line if your yard smells nasty and there's a puddle that just will not go away. The garbage disposal is leaking: This is triggered by a damaged hose or seal. We'll completely check your system to find the issue and carry out the necessary repair.</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be indicated on building plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
