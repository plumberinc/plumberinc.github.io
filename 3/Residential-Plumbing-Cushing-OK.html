This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the community system, it's still wise to bring in the professionals to limit the damage to your house.</p>

Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles however will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
