<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
