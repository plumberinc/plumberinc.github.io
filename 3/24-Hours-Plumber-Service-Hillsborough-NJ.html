<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
