<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Astoria NY</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service may appear like a waste of cash. Why buy professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick?

Handling repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
