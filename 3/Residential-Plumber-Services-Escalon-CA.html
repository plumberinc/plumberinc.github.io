<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

You might have to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
