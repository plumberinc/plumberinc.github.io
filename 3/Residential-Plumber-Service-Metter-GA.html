<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Metter GA</h3>
<p>A freshly installed hot water heater need to not produce strange noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things get worse drastically for families with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
