<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning in Somersworth NH 03878</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
