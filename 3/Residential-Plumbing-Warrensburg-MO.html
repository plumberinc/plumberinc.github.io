<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Warrensburg MO</h3>
<p>Offer us a call today, and we will dispatch among our professional plumbers to examine your circumstance and offer you with a complimentary quote on fixing or replacing your toilet. A water heater is generally a household device that includes a gas or electric heating system under a tank in which water is heated and stored.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
