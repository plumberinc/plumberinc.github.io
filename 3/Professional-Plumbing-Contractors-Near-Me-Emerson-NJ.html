Your home is over 10 years old, and you have actually never had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from retailers or kitchen and bath showrooms. Compare their expenses with what you can find online or at house improvement shops if you need a brand-new sink or faucet. They may be getting you a much better deal</p>

High efficiency, low flow toilets utilize 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals use much less water. Older toilets could be flushing up to 5 gallons per flush!
