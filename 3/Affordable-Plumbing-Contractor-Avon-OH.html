Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you definitely do not wish to get the job done before it's needed. Here's how to assess your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement.</p>

Lowered pressure principle assemblies (RPs) safeguard versus back-pressure and back-siphonage of pollutants and contaminants.
