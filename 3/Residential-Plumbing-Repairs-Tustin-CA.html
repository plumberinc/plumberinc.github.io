<p>When compared to gas models, electrical models are simpler and more economical to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
