<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
