<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage issues. When a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles.

<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue.

In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
