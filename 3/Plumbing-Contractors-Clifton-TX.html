<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals discovered in water. Usually, minerals get there because groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water till it remains in your home. Water softening uses an ion exchange process to get rid of liquified minerals that aren't as successfully gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers difficult water.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt.
