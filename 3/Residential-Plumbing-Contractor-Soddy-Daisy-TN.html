<p>When selecting a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is just a basic phone call away, why risk an insurance claim on a flooded home. A malfunctioning toilet is one household issue most of us would rather avoid. However, you can not disregard a toilet concern.

There are a few others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Since they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>
