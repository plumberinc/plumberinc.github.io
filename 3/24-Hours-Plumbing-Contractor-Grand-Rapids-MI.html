For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak.
