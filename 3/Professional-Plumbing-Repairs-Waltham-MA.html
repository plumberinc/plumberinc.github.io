<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Waltham MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be hard to repair as they are generally located behind the sink, in cramped areas. The very best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive space and need a broad swing angle, which might be challenging to obtain in little spaces.</p>
