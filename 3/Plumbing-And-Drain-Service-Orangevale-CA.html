<p>Discover the right water softener for you. One common way for a house's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in specific residences, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
