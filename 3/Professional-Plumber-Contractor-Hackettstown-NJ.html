In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant blockages: If the plunger has ended up being a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous obstructions suggest your toilet no longer has actually the power required to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
