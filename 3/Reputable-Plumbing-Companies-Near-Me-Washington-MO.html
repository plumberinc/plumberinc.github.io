<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
