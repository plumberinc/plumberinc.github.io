The largest of these primary long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
