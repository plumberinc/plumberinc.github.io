<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Muskegon MI 49442</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leaks repaired and could not be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are extremely educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your home.</p>
