<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
