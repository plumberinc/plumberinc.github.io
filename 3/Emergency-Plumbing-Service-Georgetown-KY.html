<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers should be able to raise and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible option.</p>
