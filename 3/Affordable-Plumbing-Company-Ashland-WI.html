<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the greatest indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. You might have sediment that has actually developed up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower. If your water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to speak with the specialists.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
