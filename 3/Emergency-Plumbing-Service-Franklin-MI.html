<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from corrosion and may position toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your house.
