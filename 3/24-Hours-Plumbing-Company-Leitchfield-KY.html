<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can produce sound. If your energy bills are rising, a new, greater efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing tough water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new place and positioned there.</p>

Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
