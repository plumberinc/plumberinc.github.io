<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our stiff trust accreditation standards.

If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>

It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB may be used to separate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage just.</p>
