They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls.

To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
