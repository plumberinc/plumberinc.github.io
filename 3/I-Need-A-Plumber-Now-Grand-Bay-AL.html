<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
