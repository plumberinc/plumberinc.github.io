<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The average time to install or replace a garbage disposal varies from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.
