Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
