<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a terrible impact on your company. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more use and tear than residential sewage systems and are more prone to blockages and clog. All backflow preventers should be tested each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be provided to us.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires numerous items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated. The installation must be assessed to guarantee it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test data must be built up to figure out the workings of each part. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated again to be sure it was correctly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is essential to guarantee it was fixed effectively. A correctly fixed assembly needs to provide years of protection.</p>
