If your house is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The broad disparity in rate is due to the size of your house, the kind of pipe you're setting up, and extra repairs you discover you need to make any time you go behind walls.</p>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
