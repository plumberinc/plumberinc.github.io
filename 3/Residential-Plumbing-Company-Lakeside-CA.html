<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
<p>House owners frequently bypass maintenance and take care of their waste disposal unit. When we require it, we simply anticipate this workhorse situated under the sink to work as intended.
