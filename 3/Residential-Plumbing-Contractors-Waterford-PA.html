<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust accreditation requirements.

Repairs are the appropriate fix for problems such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the whole component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Waterford PA</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
