A practical sewer line ought to constantly be sealed airtight, implying no water or gas must ever leak out. If however, you start smelling something foul coming out of your drains or around the house, there might be a crack somewhere in your sewer line.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).
