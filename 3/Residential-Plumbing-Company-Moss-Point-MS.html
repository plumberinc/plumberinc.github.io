Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
