<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a disastrous result on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience much more tear and use than residential sewers and are more vulnerable to blockages and blockage. All backflow preventers should be tested every year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report should be offered to us.</p>

Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not want to reside in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
