<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Spring City TN 37381</h3>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in different parts of the plumbing system, many frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation problems or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming altogether. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>A Pilot Light That Has Headed out: If you are not getting any warm water at all, and you use a gas water heater instead of a system with an electrical heating element, there is a likelihood your pilot burner has gone out. This might be due to the fact that of a problem with your thermocouple, an absence of flammable air, or merely a strong breeze. Regardless of what the issue is, however, your hot water heater will not be able to work up until the pilot light is re-lit.</p>
