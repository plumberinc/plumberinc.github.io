<p>It is possible to purchase disposal treatments that can help clean it and keep it odor complimentary if your unit frequently develops smells. They cost around $8 per treatment bottle. Register at the Plumbing Inspections Area personally. A PVB must be set up 12 inches above the highest emission point.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
