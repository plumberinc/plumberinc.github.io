<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.
