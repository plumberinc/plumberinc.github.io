<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>If your problem is more related to scale and mineral accumulation, it is necessary to be mindful that many scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water. Difficult water generally leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become quite undesirable.
