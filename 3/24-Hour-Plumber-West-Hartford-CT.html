If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
