<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe at Solon OH 44139</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
