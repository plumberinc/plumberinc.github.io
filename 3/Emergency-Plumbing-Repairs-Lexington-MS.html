Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
