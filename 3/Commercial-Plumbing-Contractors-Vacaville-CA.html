<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to us. Get cleaner clothing, eliminate rust spots, and utilize less cleaning agent when you soften your laundry water. Whole-house models are suitable for washing machines, or you can try laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it must be much less water.</p>
