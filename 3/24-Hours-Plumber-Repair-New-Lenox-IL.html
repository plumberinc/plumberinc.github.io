<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
