<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it could wreak unwanted concerns on your property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>A heater, no matter its fuel type, contains a large number of moving parts that wear down in time. Thanks to correct maintenance from professionals, however, this stress will take a lot longer to impact the system. Signing one of our maintenance arrangements will give your heating system a long lifespan with higher effectiveness and less repair requirements.</p>

<p>Numerous homeowners will see a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may finish the job, it's actually quite destructive to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners often use lye as the active component.
