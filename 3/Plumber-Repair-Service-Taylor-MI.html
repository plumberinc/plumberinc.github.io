<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages fixed and could not be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would certainly recommend them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that happens when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to escape, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to assist regulate the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
