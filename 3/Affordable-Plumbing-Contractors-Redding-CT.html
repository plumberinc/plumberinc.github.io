<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience blockages in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in several areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
