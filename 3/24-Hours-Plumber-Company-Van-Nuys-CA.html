<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Van Nuys CA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes 3 to five days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood suggests examining the credentials of different companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They stay the least expensive and most effective way to rid your water of problematic minerals.</p>
