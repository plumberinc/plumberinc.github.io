Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive alternative.</p>
<p>Circulation pipes shift to even smaller sized specific service pipes, bring water to private houses, home structures, businesses and stores. Depending on demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the customer center by means of a water meter that tapes flow rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Individual service pipelines are normally made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
