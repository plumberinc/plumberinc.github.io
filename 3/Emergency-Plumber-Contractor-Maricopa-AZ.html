<p>Your sewer line is among the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome problems on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Some states need steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they may also need an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing generally requires an examination or work experience or both.

<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Maricopa AZ</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your backyard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Prior to any drain cleaning company in Atlanta, GA, we will perform a camera inspection. These inspections are an essential step in determining which service will match you best.
