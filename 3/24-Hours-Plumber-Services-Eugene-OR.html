<p>Like many household appliances, your hot water heater is among those things that gets taken for granted - up until it goes kaput. Then it amasses all the attention it should have. Typically, the life-span of a lot of hot water heater is in between 10 and fifteen years. Obviously, this life expectancy differs according to the frequency of usage and care and maintenance.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Eugene OR</h3>
<p>Call us today to read more about our drain services. We're available for same-day appointments! Our team is standing by at (800) 259-7705. Roll plumber's putty in between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and cover it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening. Press the kitchen sink strainer strongly down into the putty, add the rubber gasket, friction ring and locknut under the sink, and retighten the locknut.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
