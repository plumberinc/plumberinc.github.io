<p>The majority of house owners have standard hot water heater that feature a tank where warm water is kept. While these are affordable at first buy, they are not the most efficient or reliable method for you to get warm water, especially if your system is dated.

<p>The usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
