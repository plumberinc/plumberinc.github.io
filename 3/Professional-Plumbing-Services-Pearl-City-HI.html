<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
