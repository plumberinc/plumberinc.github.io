<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Sandersville GA</h3>
<p>Bought happy medium stainless steel blade model available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I think. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. brand-new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for 2 people. There are a number of reasons that you might need to call a plumber to come to your home and unclog drains.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
