And then you can finish your shower. You need to call a professional plumber as soon as possible to prevent major consequences if you believe there might be a problem with your sewer line.

Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities clients is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County).
