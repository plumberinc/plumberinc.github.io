<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Bad Odors - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining water. Unpleasant smells are a direct outcome of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up accumulates, it can result in stronger odors, and more extreme piping concerns. Without functional draining, extreme pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak resulting in costly water damage.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is created to draw in corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from rusting. The very best way to avoid drain obstructions is to view what you flush. If you look at your home's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, little indentations or rust, your pipes are rusting. Corroding pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and must be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
