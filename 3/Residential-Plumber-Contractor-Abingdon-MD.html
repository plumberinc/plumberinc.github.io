<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it might wreak unwelcome concerns on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>List prices for home water softeners may range from around $400 to $2,700, depending on the size and kind of softener. Softeners are rated by the total variety of grains the unit can remove prior to being charged. The cost of salt is roughly $5 to $8 per 40-pound bag of salt chloride (NaCl), depending on the type bought, and approximately $25 per 40-pound bag for potassium chloride (KCl).</p>
