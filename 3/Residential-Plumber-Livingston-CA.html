<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely requires a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. The pipes typically make weird gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, leading to the odd noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
