<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Los Lunas NM 87031</h3>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
