<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is easy and cheap. But finding the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are frequently available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
