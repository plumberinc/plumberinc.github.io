<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is triggered by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

Other indications that your drain line need to be cleaned consist of unusual smells emanating from the drain itself, decreased water pressure from the tap, or overruning water or waste from a sink or toilet.
