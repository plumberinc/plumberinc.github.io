<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Mapleton UT</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
