<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
