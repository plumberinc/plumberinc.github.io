<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's drinkable water supply is created to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water going into the drinkable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
