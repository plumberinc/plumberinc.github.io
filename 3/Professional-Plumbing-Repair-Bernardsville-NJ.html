Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>House owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. As soon as a. month, utilize a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles. Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another great trick is using a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low.
