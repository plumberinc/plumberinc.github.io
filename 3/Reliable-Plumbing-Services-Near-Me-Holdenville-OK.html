<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience blockages in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is supporting. This can occur in numerous locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>The usual option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
