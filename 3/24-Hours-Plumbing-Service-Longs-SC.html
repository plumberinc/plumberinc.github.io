<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists require it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>

<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the option with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is free of hardness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
