<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the blockage with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists force it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
