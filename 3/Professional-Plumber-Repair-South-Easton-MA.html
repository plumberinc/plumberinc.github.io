<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>A lot of backflow preventers are developed to enable the elements to be removed for repair while the main body stays set up in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary in many cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be gotten rid of from the main body to facilitate a repair. Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
