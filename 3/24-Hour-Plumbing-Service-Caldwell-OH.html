<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Caldwell OH 43724</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
