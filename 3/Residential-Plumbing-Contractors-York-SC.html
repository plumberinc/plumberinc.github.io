<p>Thank you so much for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the vacations. We had been on holiday during the time of repair and it was reassuring to know it had actually been looked after and all set to go upon our return. For a plumber concentrating on drain-clearing services, expect to pay a minimum of $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. A lot of problems can be fixed in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and undamaged, without any indications of leak, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are excellent that the mounting brackets on the new unit will fit simply fine. To learn, get rid of the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
