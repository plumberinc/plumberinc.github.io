<h3>Main Sewer Line Replacement in Richland Washington</h2>
<p>Many house owners will discover a clog and instantly grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical might do the job, it's in fact quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners typically utilize lye as the active component. Lye is designed to eat through clogs and liquify them, but it likewise penetrates your pipes and produces weak spots that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
