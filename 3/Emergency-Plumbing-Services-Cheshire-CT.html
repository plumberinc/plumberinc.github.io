<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
