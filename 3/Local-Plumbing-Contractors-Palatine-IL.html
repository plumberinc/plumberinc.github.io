<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
