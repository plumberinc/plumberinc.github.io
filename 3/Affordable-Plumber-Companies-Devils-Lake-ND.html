<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to eliminate little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your house, this procedure will likely take a couple of days to a week to finish. Do not fret, while we're dealing with your house we'll cover all of your furnishings, floorings and other personal belongings so that our work does not make a mess. After the whole procedure is finished and your house is cleaned up, we'll check to make sure that water is flowing correctly through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
