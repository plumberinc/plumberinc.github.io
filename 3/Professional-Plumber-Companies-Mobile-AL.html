The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in size to offer adequate circulation.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it might scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
