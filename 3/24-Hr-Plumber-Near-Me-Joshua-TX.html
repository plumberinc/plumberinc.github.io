<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to several types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from corrosion and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house.
