<p>Thank you so much for taking the initiative to repair our water softener. over the holidays. We had been on holiday during the time of repair and it was soothing to know it had been looked after and ready to go upon our return. For a plumber specializing in drain-clearing services, expect to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. A lot of problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, include more to the hourly rate.</p>
