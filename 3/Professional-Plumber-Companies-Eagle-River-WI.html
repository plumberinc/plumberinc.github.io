Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from beneath the sink. Make certain you snap the backup ring in place.</p>
<p>When you have actually found the trip lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to connect your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
