Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
