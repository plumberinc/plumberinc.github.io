<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
