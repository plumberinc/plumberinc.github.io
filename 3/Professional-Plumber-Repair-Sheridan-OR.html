<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Sheridan OR 97378</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>

<p>It's a strangely complicated scientific procedure, but easy to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate minerals and odors discovered in difficult water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and bring in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
