Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
