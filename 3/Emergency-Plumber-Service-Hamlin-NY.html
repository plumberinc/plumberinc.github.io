<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Hamlin NY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
