Backflow prevention devices operate by enabling water to flow in just one instructions. In a vulnerable water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a structure or component. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement may stream in reverse into the safe and clean water supply.
