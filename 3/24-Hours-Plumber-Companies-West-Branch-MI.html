<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
