<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term solidity" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>

<p>It's Making Noise - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy bills are rising, a new, greater performance water heater can bring them back down.

After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new place and positioned there.</p>
