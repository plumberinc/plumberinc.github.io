<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Double Inspect Valve - Model GF8080, GF8080E - The Dual Check Valve or double backflow prevention valve is generally a stripped down Double Check Valve without turned off valves and test dicks.
