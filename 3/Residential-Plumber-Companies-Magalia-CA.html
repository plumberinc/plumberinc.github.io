<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
