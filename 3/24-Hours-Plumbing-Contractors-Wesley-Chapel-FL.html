<p>Every toilet blockages occasionally. How often a toilet clogs depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush.

Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
