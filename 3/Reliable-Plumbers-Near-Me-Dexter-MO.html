Water hardness, measured by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, varies across the U.S. from slightly tough (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
