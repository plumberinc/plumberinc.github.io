<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Center TX</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whenever you turn on a hot water tap in your house, cold water enters the heater through a pipe. The sensing unit inside the heater turns on an electric element or a burner depending on the type of tankless heater you have chosen. Water is instantly warmed and supplied through the hot water tap. There is definitely no need to wait on hot water as there is no tank and all the water is heated quickly.</p>
