<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.

Adequate drainage should likewise be supplied.</p>
