Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
