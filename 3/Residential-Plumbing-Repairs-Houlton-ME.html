<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Houlton ME</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a significant factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in many different instructions and can get huge causing invasion of the lines underground. Another fact is that tree roots look for water sources and will follow the source leading them directly to sewer lines ultimately growing right into them and triggering significant sewer line problems.</p>
