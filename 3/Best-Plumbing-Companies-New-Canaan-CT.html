<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to weaken from rust and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house. This might not require completely repiping the house, since more recent materials may have already been utilized in some sections, such as the bathroom plumbing.
