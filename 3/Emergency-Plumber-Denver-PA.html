<p>Your home's drains and pipes quietly eliminate thousands of gallons of wastewater from your home every year without you even providing a reservation. However, when hair, food scraps, womanly health items, toys, and other foreign things make their way into your drains, they can cause major problems.

<p>While some problems can merely be fixed, others need a full replacement. If your toilet bowl is split or leaking, or if the valve assembly is shot, toilet replacement is the very best solution for your problem. Our plumbers have years of experience changing toilets in the Baltimore County area and will ensure that your new toilet will be set up correctly so that it doesn't move or leak.</p>

Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
