<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures at Lexington OK 73051</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
