Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
