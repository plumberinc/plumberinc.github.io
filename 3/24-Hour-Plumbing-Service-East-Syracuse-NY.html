We now have actually cleaned up and inspected the components parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the elements to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each component is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the right place.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
