Many producers do not have pressure loss info for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no maker's literature is offered.</p>
<p>Next, acknowledge that unless your water is exceptionally tough, all the inbound water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry connections probably ought to be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In some cases, you may prefer to soften the hot water only.

I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
