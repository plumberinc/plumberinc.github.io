<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at North Bergen NJ 07047</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
