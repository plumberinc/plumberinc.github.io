For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
