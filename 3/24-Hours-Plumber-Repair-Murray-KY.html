<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
