<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does.

No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen more often than you believe! Typically it takes place at night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
