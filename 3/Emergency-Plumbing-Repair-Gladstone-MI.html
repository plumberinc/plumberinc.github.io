<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
