<p>In water supply systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Testing: A preventative check on your gas lines averages between $50 and $75 a check out, and it must include a pressure test to check for leaks accurately.
