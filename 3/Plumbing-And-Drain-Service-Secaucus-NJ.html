<p>Sadly, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the green and blue discolorations being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
