Instead of removing the obstruction with negative pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
