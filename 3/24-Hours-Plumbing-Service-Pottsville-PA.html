<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for at least half of the plumbing emergency situations that we run into in your houses around the Bay Area. The preliminary issues that take place are the discoloration of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that might have a foul smell. It can also cause spots in clothes put in the washing machine. If your home is over 50 years old, it's a good bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000. The broad variation in cost is because of the size of your house, the kind of pipe you're setting up, and extra repairs you discover you need to make any time you go behind walls.</p>
<p>A Water Softener is a filtration system that works to get rid of high concentrations of calcium and magnesium that cause tough water. When water streams through a Water Softener, the system filters out these difficult water minerals and the softened water then leaves the water softening system to flow through plumbing. State certified backflow technicians, readily available through your grass irrigation company or plumber can determine whether or not your equipment fulfills the requirements. The regulations also require a state certified backflow specialist test the backflow preventer yearly.</p>
