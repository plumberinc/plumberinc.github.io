<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In homes with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
