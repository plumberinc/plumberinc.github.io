<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure.

The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lowell MA</h3>

Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage needs to likewise be offered.</p>
