<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lowell MA</h3>

Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to likewise be offered.</p>
