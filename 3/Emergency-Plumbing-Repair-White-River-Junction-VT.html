<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen up the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the within. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
