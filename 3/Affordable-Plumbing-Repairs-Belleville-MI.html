<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions.

Tip: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.
