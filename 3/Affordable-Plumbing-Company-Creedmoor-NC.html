Scale deposits also collect to plug plumbing fixtures and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, therefore affecting their efficiency.</p>

Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
