<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Fremont OH 43420</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
