However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think! When you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
