That's not all, a gas leak fire also causes other gas-run appliances to take off such as clothes dryer, water stoves, heaters, and fireplaces.</p>
<p>Circulation pipes shift to even smaller individual service pipes, carrying water to specific houses, apartment or condo structures, stores and businesses. Depending upon demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water enters the customer facility through a water meter that tape-records flow rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Individual service pipelines are usually made from plastic, type or lead K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
