<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from corrosion and might place toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home. This might not require entirely repiping the house, because newer products may have already been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you determine precisely what work requires to be done.</p>

<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure.
