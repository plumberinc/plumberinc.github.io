<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
