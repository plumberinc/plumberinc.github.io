<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
