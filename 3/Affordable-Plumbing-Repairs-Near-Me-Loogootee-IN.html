<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the new heater.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
