<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
