<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
