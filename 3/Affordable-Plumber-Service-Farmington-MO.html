<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>

<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be eliminated relatively easily by using an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take unnecessary advantage of an unsuspecting public.</p>
