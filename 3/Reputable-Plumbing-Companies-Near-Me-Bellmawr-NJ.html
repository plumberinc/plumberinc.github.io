<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>It's not a need, but a waste disposal unit will make life in your Chicago area house simpler.
