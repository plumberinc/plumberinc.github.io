<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be gotten rid of fairly easily by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the solidity ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly extreme rates, or otherwise take excessive advantage of an unwary public.</p>
