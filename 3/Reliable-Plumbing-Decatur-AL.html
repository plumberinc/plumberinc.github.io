Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the clog, working even more into where the blockage is taking place.

That implies if something goes wrong later, you will have somebody who can fix it without any included expenses.

When that takes place, you will probably need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your mistakes, and chances are they will cost more and be harder than if you had simply called a professional in the very first place.</p>
