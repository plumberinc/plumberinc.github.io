<h3>Slab Leak Repair in Markham Illinois</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with debris, hair, or toilet paper? After years of usage, drains can collect harmful build-up.

We can accomplish this through a variety of methods such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
