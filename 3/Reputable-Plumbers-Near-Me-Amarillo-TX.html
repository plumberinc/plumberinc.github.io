If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater very rapidly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
