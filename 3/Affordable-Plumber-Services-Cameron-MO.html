<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
