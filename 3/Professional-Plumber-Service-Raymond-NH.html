<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, typically called "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to obtain consistency amongst the numerous jurisdictions within the State; minimize the structure's energy and water use; reduce waste; and reduce the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can sometimes get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>As is the case with any plumbing appliance or water treatment system, your water softener should be professionally set up and serviced. This is the only way to make sure that your system can handle the need of your household, and that it will actually get the job done effectively. Maintenance needs are minimal, however it does pay to have the system examined for proper operation routinely.</p>
