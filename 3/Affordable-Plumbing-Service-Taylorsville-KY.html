<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>A water softener gets rid of minerals that develop water hardness, one of the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water damages home appliances, leaves cloudy soap residue across kitchen areas and bathrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on difficult water for their cleaning, cooking, and bathing, water softeners serve an essential function. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely messed up water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Purchasing a water softener saves you time, energy, and cash, and secures your home and your residential or commercial property.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is a terrific next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be serious problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home should have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working appropriately, you are off to a good start.</p>
