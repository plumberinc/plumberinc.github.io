<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Harlingen TX</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly hazardous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company employee had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other connected to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the supply of water system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water system.</p>
