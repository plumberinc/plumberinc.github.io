<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and after that annually.</p>
