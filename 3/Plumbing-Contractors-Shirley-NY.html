Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with.

A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is likely cracked and just requires to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
