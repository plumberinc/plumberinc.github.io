Backflow prevention devices operate by permitting water to flow in only one direction.

When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw polluted water in reverse into the water system. For instance, cleaning fluids might be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow backwards into the potable water supply. To protect water quality, backflow protection is required where the end user positions a risk of polluting the city's water system.</p>
