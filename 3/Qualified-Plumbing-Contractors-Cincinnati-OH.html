<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is a natural solution that's both safe to your plumbing and incredibly effective at removing grime, waste, and organic product that so often blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially repairing the issue. Bio-Clean is an option of live bacteria that actively seek out natural material and gnaw at it, developing safe by-products of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are easily dealt with at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had numerous plumbing leaks fixed and couldn't be better with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>

And it so happens that our bathroom and kitchen sinks start acting up at the most inconvenient times, like when we're having more than dinner visitors, or when we're running late for operate in the early morning. Consider a tankless water heater if you're looking to save on energy costs and would like hot water on demand. These units need less maintenance and last longer (over 20 years) than the standard water heater.</p>

To fix your pipes, we utilize remote video cameras to determine the source and inspect of the problem quickly and efficiently.
