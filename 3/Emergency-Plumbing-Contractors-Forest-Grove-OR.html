<p>Liquid drain cleaner sold at your local home improvement big box shop can aid with a couple of things, however it's really pretty limited in its capability to fix problems inside your drains and it can be corrosive and damaging to many types of pipes. Unless you have a method to see inside the drain, there is also no warranty that drain cleaner is even going to work. When you work with a professional plumber, they have specialized tools that will allow them to see inside your drains and determine the problem, then they have the right tools to fix any kind of problem that you might have. No thinking games, no crossing your fingers and hoping that the drain cleaner repairs whatever is wrong down there.</p>
<p>As a business owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a devastating impact on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience far more tear and wear than residential sewers and are more vulnerable to blockages and obstruction. All backflow preventers need to be checked yearly by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be provided to us.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that might require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your business, they can cause financial losses and in some instances can stop your company entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a little office the concerns brought on by even small drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
