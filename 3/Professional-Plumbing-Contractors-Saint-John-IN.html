For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.

<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area. The California Department of Health Services requires each of these assemblies to be checked every year. This testing is done by backflow assembly testers authorized by the Orange County Healthcare Agency. A list of the certified testers is available online.
