<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
