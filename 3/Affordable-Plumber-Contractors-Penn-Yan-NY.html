<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>

No, it is not a frequent event, however it does happen more often than you think! Often it happens in the evening when you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
