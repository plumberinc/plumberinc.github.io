<h3>Water Heater Replacement in Watertown South Dakota</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
