<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Lincoln CA 95648</h3>

Our plumbers often perform a dye test to pinpoint the source because the source of leaking water can be hard to identify. Frequently, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly unclean or stained and often gets incorrect for a supply of water line leak.</p>
