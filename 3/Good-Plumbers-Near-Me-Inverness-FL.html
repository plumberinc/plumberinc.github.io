<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No warm water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement. While a few of these concerns can be credited to typical wear and tear or inappropriate installation, in some cases your waste disposal unit becomes harmed by products that shouldn't be run through it.</p>
<p>Many sink issues are repairable. It can last for years and might just need replacement once a kitchen is renovated if a sink is properly taken care of. However, some instances need a sink to be replaced. Cosmetic damage is acceptable if it doesn't hamper the performance of a sink.

Blanton Plumbing are experienced and licensed, and we can guarantee your disposal will be installed correctly and work exactly as it should.

<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>

The 2009 Michigan Plumbing Code went into effect August 20, 2010. Provisions for one- and two-family residences are included in the 2009 Michigan Residential Code.</p>
