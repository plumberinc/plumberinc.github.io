<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Sedro Woolley WA</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and significant leaks. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can really be the cheaper and better long-term service.</p>
