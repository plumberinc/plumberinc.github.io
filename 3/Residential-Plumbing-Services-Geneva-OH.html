<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride.

<p>But is a plumbing disaster impending or simply a concern for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly do not want to do the job prior to it's needed. Here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
