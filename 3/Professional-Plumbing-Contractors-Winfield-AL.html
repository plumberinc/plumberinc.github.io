<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Examining the water meter is a terrific next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. There is a leak someplace and this could be serious problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house must have water. This opts for every other shut down valve and their corresponding faucets. If everything is working appropriately, you are off to a good start.</p>
