<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Sealy TX 77474? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

Lastly, the drywall and other products will be fixed, covered, and retextured so that it appears like absolutely nothing ever took place. Polyvinylchloride pipes or PVC pipes are frequently utilized for the main water supply to your home along with the home sinks, toilet, and bathtub drain lines or vent stacks. Due to the strengths of PVC, it is among the most utilized plastics worldwide.</p>
