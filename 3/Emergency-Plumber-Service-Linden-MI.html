It is suggested that you allow your system to go empty of one kind of salt prior to adding another to prevent the event of any problems.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
