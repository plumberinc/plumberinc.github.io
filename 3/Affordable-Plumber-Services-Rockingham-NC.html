<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
