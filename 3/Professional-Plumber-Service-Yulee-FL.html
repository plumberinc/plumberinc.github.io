<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be assessed. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that might cause false data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that might damage components. The effects of elevated temperature level can also cause extreme pressure conditions which might harm the parts in the components. These and other negative effects from the hydraulic conditions must be recognized and their cause fixed. The new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied.</p>
