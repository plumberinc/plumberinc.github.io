<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
