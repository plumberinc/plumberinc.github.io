<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that corrode with time, causing leaks or other problems. Additionally, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can restrict airflow and make it difficult to utilize one or more of your gas-powered home appliances like the clothes dryer or stove.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
