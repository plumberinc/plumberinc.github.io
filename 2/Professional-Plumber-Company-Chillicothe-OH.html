When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
