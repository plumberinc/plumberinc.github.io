<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
