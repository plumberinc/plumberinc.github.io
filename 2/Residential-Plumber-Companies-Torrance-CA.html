The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

Assemblies not currently noted must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh.
