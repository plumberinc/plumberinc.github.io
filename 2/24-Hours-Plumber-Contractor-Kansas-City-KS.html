<p>Lots of bad things are being stated on this article about liners. I find that many old time plumbers are not informed on liners and have no idea on what they are stating.

With time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
