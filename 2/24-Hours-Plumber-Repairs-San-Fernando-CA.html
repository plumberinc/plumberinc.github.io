<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services San Fernando CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
