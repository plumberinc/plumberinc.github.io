<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Landenberg PA 19350</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal".

Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
