<p>The secret to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby removing solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They quickly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, as with each person we've come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and very knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either little or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
