There are several factors you might need to repipe your house or company. Deterioration of pipes may trigger low water pressure, rusty colored water, decreased water flow, or leaks. If you are going to redesign it is a good time to repipe before you paint or complete your walls.  It is essential to understand the scope of the task prior to work is started.
