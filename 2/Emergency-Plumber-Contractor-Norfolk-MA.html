Backflow prevention devices run by allowing water to flow in only one direction. In a vulnerable water service connection, drinkable water can stream both in and out of a structure or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water backwards into the water supply. For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement may flow backwards into the potable water system.
