<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be better with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely educated, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you think! When you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes, often it occurs at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
