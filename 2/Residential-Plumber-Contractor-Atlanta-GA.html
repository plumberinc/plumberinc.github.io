<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
