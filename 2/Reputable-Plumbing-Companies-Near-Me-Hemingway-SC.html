Continuous feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, nevertheless, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>

So, if you observe any of the following indications when you have had your disposal for about this quantity of time, then you are best about prepared for a new one.
