<p>Leakages are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
