It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
