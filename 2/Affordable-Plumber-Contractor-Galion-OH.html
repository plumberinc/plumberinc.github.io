<p>If you can find the part that's causing the issue, a leaky garbage disposal can be fixed.

<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated clinical procedure, however simple to correct. It utilizes salt to remove odors and minerals discovered in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
