<p>If your old sink flange is tight and undamaged, with no indications of leak, you can probably leave it in location.

<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or short-term connection between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds.

<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; obtain the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
