Paper towels can quickly block the toilet drain line or trigger a clog further down the drain. Womanly health products should be gotten rid of in the garbage and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending upon the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.
