We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-lasting solution.</p>
