<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific procedure, but simple to treat. It uses salt to remove minerals and odors discovered in hard water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that bring in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
