<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a brand-new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>It's important to be conscious that a lot of scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water if your problem is more related to scale and mineral build-up.
