<p>Inspect the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in new houses, but lots of homes constructed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and changed with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber.</p>
