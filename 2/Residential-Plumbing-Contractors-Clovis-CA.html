<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at Clovis CA 93611</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
