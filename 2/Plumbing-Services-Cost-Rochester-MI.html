<p>Great deals of bad things are being stated on this post about liners. I discover that many old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying.

If this heater is installed in a house with numerous bathrooms, the piping process adds to the installation expenses.</p>
<p>Overall time 1 hour. Bought retail. Get the plumbers putty at purchase. Cut off devoted power 1st. I followed good step-by-step instructions.
