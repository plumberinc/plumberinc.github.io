Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce weird sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things worsen drastically for households with a high need for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement may be required if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
