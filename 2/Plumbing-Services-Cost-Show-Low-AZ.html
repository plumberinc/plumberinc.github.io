<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.

<p>This post aims to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively configured water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few confusing truths that often lead people to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, right?
