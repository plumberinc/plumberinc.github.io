<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
