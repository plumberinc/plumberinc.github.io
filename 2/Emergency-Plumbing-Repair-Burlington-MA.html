<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping).

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

At City Plumbing, we not only help with repair concerns but also we provide gas line installation services as the simplest way to fix problems originating from an old system.</p>
