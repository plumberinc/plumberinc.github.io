<p>Sewers, drains and waste piping are checked for proper grading to maintain downward flow. The plumbing system is checked for leakages. We check that the product used in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing laboratory. We restrict cross connections between safe water and water from a doubtful source and prohibit the discharge of hazardous waste to the sewer system. We also examine the vent pipes to balance the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
