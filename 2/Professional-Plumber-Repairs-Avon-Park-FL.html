Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
