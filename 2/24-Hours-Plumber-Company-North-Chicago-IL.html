<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
