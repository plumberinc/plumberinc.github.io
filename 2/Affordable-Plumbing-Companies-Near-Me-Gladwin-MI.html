<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers in addition to foundation repair professionals.</p>

Apprentice programs are the most common method for plumbers to discover the skills needed to become effective in the trade.

Programs generally last four to 5 years and need apprentices to finish a specific number of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
