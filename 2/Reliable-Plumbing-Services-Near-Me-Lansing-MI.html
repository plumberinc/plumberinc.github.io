<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
