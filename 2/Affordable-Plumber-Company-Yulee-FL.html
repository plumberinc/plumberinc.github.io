<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
