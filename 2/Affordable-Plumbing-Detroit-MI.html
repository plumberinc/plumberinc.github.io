<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Detroit MI 48228</h3>
<p>The secret to the technology is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
