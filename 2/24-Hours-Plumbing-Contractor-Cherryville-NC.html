<p>Particles such as foreign things - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become lodged in between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will ultimately obstruct the flow of your water prior to triggering a clog. Likewise, if excessive toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic items are flushed, a clog can happen.

<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that create water hardness, among the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Hard water ruins home appliances, leaves filmy soap scum throughout bathrooms and cooking areas, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States counting on tough water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve an important purpose.

Investing in a water softener saves you energy, money, and time, and protects your home and your property.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Whether you need garbage disposal repair or installation, Maeser can assist. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen appliance in most houses today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other object jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the threat of drain clogs.</p>
