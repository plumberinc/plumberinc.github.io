<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

Here are a few confusing realities that often lead people to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, right? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
