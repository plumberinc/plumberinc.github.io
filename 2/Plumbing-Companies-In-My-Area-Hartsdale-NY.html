Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
