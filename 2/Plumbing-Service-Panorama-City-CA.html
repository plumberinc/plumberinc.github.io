<p>As soon as you've found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
