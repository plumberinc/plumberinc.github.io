<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to likewise be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and split or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location.
