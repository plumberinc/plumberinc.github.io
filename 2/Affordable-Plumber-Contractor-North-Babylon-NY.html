Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
