The temperature and pressure relief valve is a security device that restricts tank pressure and keeps it from taking off (Picture 4). A brand-new one must be included with every installation.

<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating properly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
