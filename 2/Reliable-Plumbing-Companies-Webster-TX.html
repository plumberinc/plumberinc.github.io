<p>They will normally stand behind their work with an assurance if you're working with a reputable plumber in Utah.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
