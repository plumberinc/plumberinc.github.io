<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
