<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing suffers from many obstructions, leakages, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you should speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. House owners must examine water pressure entering their house on a regular basis. Water pressure must be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can be available in at over 100 PSI.</p>
