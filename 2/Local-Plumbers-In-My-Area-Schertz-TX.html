<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Schertz TX 78154</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
