<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Local or state government typically imposes backflow prevention. Consult your local jurisdiction on backflow prevention requirement and devices. In a watering system, backflow has two causes: back siphonage or back pressure.

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
