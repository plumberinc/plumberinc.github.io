<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
