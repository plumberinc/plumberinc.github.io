<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe should be used that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the moisture out.

Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply.
