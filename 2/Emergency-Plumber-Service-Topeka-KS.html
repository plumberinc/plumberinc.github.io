<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water system and private on-site water system and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>Switch on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mix bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work.
