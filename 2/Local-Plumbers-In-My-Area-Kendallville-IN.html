<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
