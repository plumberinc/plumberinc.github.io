<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
