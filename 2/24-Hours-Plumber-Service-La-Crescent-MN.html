<p>In truth, reverse flow testing created to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Instead, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are effectively tested by certified personnel.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that might result in incorrect data on the workings of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can cause extreme pressure spikes that could harm parts. The effects of elevated temperature can likewise cause excessive pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions should be recognized and their cause fixed. The new parts can soon be made inoperative if parts are replaced and the hydraulic conditions are not corrected.</p>
