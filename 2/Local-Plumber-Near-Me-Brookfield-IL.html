Beyond physical harm, gas line leakages can also cause extreme damage to your pipes, indicating more of your hard-earned money spent on repairs.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
