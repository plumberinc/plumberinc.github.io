<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
