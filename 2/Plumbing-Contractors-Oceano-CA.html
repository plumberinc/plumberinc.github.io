<p>Out-of-date water heaters more than ten years old or systems that just aren't satisfying your household's water heating needs are also great candidates for replacement.

The experts at Nixco Plumbing Inc. can fix problems with your warm water rapidly and help you determine whether a repair or a replacement in the most affordable alternative.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
