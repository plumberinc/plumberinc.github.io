Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
