<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.
