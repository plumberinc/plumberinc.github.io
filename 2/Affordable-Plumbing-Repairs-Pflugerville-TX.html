<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is called fouling. Often it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are offered.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
