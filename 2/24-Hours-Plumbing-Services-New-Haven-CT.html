<p>When compared to gas designs, electric designs are easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electric models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
