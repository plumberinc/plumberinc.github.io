<p>When Bill Howe sets up and offers the disposal for installation, clients receive a full 1 year parts and labor service warranty. What that implies for clients is that if the disposal stops working for any reason, we will return out at no charge and install a new disposal. Customers need to also sign up the disposal to benefit from the producer guarantee period.</p>

<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.
