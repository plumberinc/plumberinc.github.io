<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
