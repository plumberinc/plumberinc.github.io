<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
