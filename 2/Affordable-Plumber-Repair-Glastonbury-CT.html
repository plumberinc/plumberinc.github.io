<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the house. Generally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs many items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated. The installation needs to be evaluated to guarantee it does not circumvent the operations of the assembly. Test data should be collected to figure out the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be tested once again to be sure it was effectively repaired. Comparing the test arises from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flowchart is needed to guarantee it was fixed appropriately. An effectively fixed assembly must provide years of security.</p>
