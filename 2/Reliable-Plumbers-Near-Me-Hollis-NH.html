<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Hollis NH</h3>
<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a gas water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring repairs and leaks. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
