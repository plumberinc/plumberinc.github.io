<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>A well-designed irrigation system is very important for the health of plants in a landscape but it's likewise crucial for human health. A successful irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from potable drinking water, preventing contamination that can trigger health problems.
