<p>A water softener removes minerals that create water solidity, one of the most typical water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water destroys appliances, leaves cloudy soap scum throughout kitchens and bathrooms, and dries out hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on difficult water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve a vital function. A water softener conserves you from replacing prematurely ruined water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener conserves you time, cash, and energy, and safeguards your home and your residential or commercial property.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>

We provide a range of choices for homes and companies that eliminate undesirable minerals and increase the performance of water associated home appliances.
