For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>

A water supply source can take many forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, man-made or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
