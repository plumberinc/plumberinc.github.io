<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Lumberton NJ</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Lumberton NJ 08048</h3>
<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning group is proud to use Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both harmless to your plumbing and remarkably reliable at eliminating grime, waste, and organic material that so typically clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and just partially fixing the issue. Bio-Clean is an option of live germs that actively look for natural product and gnaw at it, creating harmless by-products of carbon water, mineral, and dioxide ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its install. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
