<p>In water supply systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Unfortunately, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it often becomes destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time.
