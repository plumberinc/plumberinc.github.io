<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another consultation.
