<p>Leaks are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where hardness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline kind that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regrowth.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl).
