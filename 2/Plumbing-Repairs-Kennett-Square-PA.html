<p>Hard water reduces the life-span of lots of major devices and systems in your house due to the amount of limescale and sediment accumulation that happens. Limescale on pipes can cause rust and blockages, which not only shortens the lifespan of the pipes however puts you in a position where you might need to spend for a pricey repair.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air.

This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
