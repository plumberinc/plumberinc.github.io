Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
