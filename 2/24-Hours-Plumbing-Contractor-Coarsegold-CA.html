<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for calling to upgrade us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than anticipated, that's understandable, by keeping us notified of the small delay, we didn't have to worry. We called on Ron Steele Plumbing to install new water supply and drain lines during our master bathroom remodeling project. Not only were they very affordable, but the professional service and quality installation exceeded our expectations.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Coarsegold CA 93614</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
