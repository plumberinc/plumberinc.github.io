<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair in Bayville New Jersey</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have achieved a development in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes short-term hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of existing softening technologies.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
