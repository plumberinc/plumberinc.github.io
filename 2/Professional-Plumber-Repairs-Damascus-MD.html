<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
