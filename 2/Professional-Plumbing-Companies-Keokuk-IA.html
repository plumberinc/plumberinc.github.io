<p>Discover the right water softener for you. One typical method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private houses, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and infecting the general public water system.</p>
