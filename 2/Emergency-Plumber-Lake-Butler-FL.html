<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an important kitchen appliance in the majority of houses today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
