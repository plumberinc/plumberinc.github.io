You might have an idea of where your lateral is located if you have had plumbing service prior to planting. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line.

If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to identify.</p>
<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an important kitchen appliance in the majority of houses today. While a lot of kitchen sink disposers can handle nearly any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Worn impellers on older disposals can end up being inefficient, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
