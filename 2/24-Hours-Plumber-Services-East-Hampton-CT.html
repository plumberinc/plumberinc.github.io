<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour East Hampton CT</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The Albuquerque Water Authority offers rebates for installing low flow toilets, urinals, and low circulation showerheads. High efficiency, low circulation toilets use 1.28 gallons per flush and urinals utilize much less water. Older toilets could be flushing up to 5 gallons per flush! Refunds of as much as $100 are readily available for low flow toilets. This could offset the majority of the rate of the toilet depending on the design you choose.</p>
