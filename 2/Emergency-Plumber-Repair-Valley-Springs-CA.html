<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if necessary. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be difficult to repair as they are normally located behind the sink, in confined areas. The best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much space and need a broad swing angle, which might be hard to get in small spaces.</p>
