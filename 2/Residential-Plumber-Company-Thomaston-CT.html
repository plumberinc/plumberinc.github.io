<p>They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, but I give the company props for calling to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than anticipated, that's reasonable, by keeping us notified of the small delay, we didn't have to fret.

<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on 3 different events, the last including a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our professionals and they were great. They rapidly found the leak and repaired it without making a substantial mess. They, just like everyone we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and very educated. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers might be needed on a variety of other locations in a house or organisations either to isolated the home from the general public water supply or to obstruct internal backflows in a building's plumbing system. Examples are medical offices, dining establishments and convenience stores. Tankless water heaters are also referred to as on demand water heaters. These units make good sense for property owners for a number of factors. They save energy, save cash, and deliver hot water to you instantaneously. In vacation or second homes they can be especially preferable.</p>
