Much of these leaks can be fixed, but if they end up being bigger and more frequent, you ought to consider total system replacement.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

If your hot water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to consult the specialists.</p>
