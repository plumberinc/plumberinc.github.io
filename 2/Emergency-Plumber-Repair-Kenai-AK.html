<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and combined with water. , if you prepare to drain your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) once you have actually discovered the trip lever you want remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
