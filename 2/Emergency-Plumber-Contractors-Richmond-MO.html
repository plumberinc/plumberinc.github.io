<p>Leakages are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
