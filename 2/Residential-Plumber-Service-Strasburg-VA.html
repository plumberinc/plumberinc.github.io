<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is linked to its install.
