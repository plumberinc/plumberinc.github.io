<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a correctly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage should likewise be offered.</p>
