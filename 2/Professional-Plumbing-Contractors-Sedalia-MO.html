<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to get rid of chloride. The chloride travels through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams. In houses with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
