It should likewise be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>
