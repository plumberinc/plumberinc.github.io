<p>Leakages are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
