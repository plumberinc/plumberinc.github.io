<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that must also be well kept to assist avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to crack and harden or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
