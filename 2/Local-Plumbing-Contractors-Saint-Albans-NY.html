<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. The water heater tank need to have some room to represent the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the growth happening when boiling the water causes the tank to break and start leaking. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Blockages that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional support. Continued attempts by yourself can hurt your lines, and you might have a more severe underlying issue than you understand. In addition, the longer you delay to require professional assistance, the higher the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
