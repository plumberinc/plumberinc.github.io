<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service North Salt Lake UT</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select must be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
