<p>As a company owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a disastrous impact on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and wear than residential drains and are more susceptible to obstructions and blockage. All backflow preventers need to be tested each year by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester and after repair or replacement. A copy of the test report must be supplied to us.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on residential or commercial properties change that might need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your service, they can trigger monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your service entirely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a little workplace the problems triggered by even little drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that only original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
