<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Catasauqua PA 18032</h3>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your sink, bathtub, or shower) can be treated quickly if the blockage is easy and shallow. For a lot of clogs you'll simply need a plunger, and sometimes some chemicals, but if this does not resolve the issue then you may also have to employ a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
