<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a lp hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Recurring leakages and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we recommend replacing your system if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
