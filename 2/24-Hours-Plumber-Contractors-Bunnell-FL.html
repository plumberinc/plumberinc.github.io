<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Bunnell FL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
