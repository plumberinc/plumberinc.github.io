<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Rocky Point NY</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
