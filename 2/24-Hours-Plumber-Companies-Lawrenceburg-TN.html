<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you have actually found the journey lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
