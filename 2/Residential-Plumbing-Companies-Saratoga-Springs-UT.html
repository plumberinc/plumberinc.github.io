A water heater that is not installed correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

Evacuate the structure immediately and contact your gas company or emergency services if you currently smell or think a gas leak. Hot water heater must be purchased through Gillece Services.</p>
