Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can posture problems.</p>

Installations must only be performed by plumbers as the installation needs both plumbing and electrical connections.</p>
