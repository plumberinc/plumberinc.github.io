<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The steps for changing a gas hot water heater are precisely the exact same, and those for an electric water heater are comparable. Recurring leaks and repairs.

When uncontrolled water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is MUCH more affordable than mold removal or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we advise repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your entire home.</p>
