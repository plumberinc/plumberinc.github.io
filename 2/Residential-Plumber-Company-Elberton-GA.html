Installation of the iron-removal equipment may be required (see the NDSU publication Iron and Manganese" (AE1030) Water test outcomes will assist make that decision.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
