<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
