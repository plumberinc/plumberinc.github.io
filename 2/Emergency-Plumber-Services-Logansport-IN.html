Sanford & Child plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Checking the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. There is a leak someplace and this might be major problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house must have water.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
