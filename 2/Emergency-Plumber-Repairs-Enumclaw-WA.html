Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
