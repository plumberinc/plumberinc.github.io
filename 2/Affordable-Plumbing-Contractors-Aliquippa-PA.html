<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Since copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the ceilings and walls. They will just get rid of as much structure material as essential to reach, detach, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling below it. You can organize to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel if you want.</p>
