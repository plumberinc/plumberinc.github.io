<h3>When To Call A Plumber Southampton NY</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water thought about hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Normally, minerals get there since groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as successfully gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes hard water.</p>
