<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer needs numerous items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation must be evaluated to guarantee it does not prevent the functions of the assembly. Test data need to be accumulated to identify the functions of each component. The backflow prevention assembly need to be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested once again to be sure it was properly fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is necessary to guarantee it was repaired effectively. A correctly fixed assembly needs to offer years of defense.</p>
