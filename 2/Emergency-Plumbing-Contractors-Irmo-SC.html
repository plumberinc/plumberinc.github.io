<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are set up in areas where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.

<p>Sadly, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
