<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water could cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment.

Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
