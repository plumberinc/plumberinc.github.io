<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is designed to bring in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from rusting. The best method to avoid drain obstructions is to view what you flush.

Even your water lines must be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will get unique attention, a skilled plumber aims to analyze the complete health of your system.

<p>Examine the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Check below to be sure there aren't any leakages. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of properly. Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new houses, but lots of houses developed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When found and replaced with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber.</p>
