<p>Physical strength. Steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters should have the ability to lift and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen up the clamp and get rid of the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are degrading slowly from the inside. For the most part, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
