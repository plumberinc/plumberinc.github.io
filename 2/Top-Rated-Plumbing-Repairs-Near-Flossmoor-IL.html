<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
