In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leaks, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-lasting service.</p>
