<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
