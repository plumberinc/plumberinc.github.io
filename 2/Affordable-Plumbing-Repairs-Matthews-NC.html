<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, most frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow problems or even stop a fixture from streaming completely. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
