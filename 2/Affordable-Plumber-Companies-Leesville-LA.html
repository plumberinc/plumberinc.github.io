<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners remove calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water conserves you cash. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>

<p>In order to insure the proper operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it must be checked and certified upon installation and a minimum of once a year thereafter if installed to secure form a health threat scenario. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, use, or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed.

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
