<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some homes were allowed to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of one or more toilets in the home. Typically, the supply of water to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be evaluated and certified upon installation and at least once a year thereafter if installed to secure form a health danger situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers supervise these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, use, or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked periodically to make sure that they are functioning properly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with appropriately adjusted gauge devices.</p>
