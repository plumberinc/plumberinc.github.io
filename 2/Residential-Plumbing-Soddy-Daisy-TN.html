<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Soddy Daisy TN 37379</h3>
<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
