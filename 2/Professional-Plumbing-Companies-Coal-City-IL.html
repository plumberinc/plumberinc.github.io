<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
