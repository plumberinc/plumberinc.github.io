<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the public water system from toxins and contaminants that could, under certain situations, be drawn into the public water system from private properties. If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost mostly depends on the toilet you pick. Toilets vary in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more pricey than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>

Without constant testing and servicing, these systems can permit polluted water to flow freely within your supply pipes, developing a major health threat to building occupants. Each backflow prevention system needs various testing treatments and periods, and needs considerable experience and understanding.</p>
