The largest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and varied sources.</p>
