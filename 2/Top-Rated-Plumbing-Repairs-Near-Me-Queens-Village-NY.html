<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Queens Village NY 11429</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and split or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever is in great shape.</p>
<p>From below the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Protect the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make sure the drain compression seal is seated correctly in the drain locknut, then tighten up the drain and re-install locknut. Finally, turn on the water and test for leaks.</p>
