<p>Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.

Get rid of the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
