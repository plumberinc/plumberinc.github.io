<p>Rust: The most typical issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is especially true if you have unattended hard water, which includes harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages often mean a brand-new unit replacement is in order.</p>
