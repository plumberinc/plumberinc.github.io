<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by protecting your water-using devices from bad performance and early failure. Some tough water problems are extremely visible, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater aspects and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Noticeable or unnoticeable, these problems have genuine costs related to them. Clogged components cause replacement or reconditioning expenses and can irritate your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely damaged RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement costs. Quickly, these little expenses can amount to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
