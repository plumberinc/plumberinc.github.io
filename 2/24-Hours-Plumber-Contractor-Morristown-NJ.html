<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business. Figure out the size of the water pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>As soon as in awhile, every toilet obstructions. How often a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush. If your toilet clogs more than when a month-or even when a week!- it's probably since mineral deposits have developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
