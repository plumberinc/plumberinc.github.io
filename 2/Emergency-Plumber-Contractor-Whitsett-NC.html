<h3>Clogged Tub in Whitsett North Carolina</h2>
<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and ends up in our lakes and streams. In houses with private wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic tank and then winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
