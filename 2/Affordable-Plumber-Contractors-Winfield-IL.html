<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Winfield IL</h3>
<p>A recently set up hot water heater need to not produce unusual sounds, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater goes to warm the water. Things intensify dramatically for homes with a high need for warm water. The factors for the noises can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement may be necessary if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed.</p>
