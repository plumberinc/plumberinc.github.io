<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called deterioration. Deterioration can literally consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or modify the tolerances triggering parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of rust on a metal alloy need to be examined to identify if the part is usable or should be changed.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.
