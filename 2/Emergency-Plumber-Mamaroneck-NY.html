Constant feed disposals are easy to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>
