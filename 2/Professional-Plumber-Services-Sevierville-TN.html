<p>This short article intends to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a couple of complicated truths that typically lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is normally corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be corrosive, best? This is a fallacy because naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
