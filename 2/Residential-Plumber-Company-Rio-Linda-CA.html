<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more susceptible and breakable to breaking, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural stresses and strains as an outcome of temperature change and ice formation. And these differences determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
