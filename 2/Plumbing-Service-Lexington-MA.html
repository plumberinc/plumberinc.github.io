<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI.

The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
