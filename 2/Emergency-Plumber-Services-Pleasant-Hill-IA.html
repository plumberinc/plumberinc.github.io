<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Pleasant Hill IA</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet replacements and repairs are a natural part of being a property owner. You might sustain much more pricey residential or commercial property damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs. Even a slow leak can destroy your floors and subfloors - resulting in significant repairs and even replacing the whole floor. An overruning toilet can flood your bathroom, leading to unsanitary conditions, wood rot, and mold growth.
