<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

Over time, the material your drain is made of can start to wear away, deteriorate, and eventually crack with regular usage, leading to a leak.
