<p>The quality of your house's H2O matters. You do not want to worry about the troubles of tough water, and with NuvoH2O, you no longer need to! Our tankless, natural citric acid water softener is the best-rated, salt-free water softener on the marketplace-- that's why companies like Walgreens, HGTV, Popular Science, Panda Express, and more trust us to soften their water.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
