As a result, the softening reservoirs have to be cleaned far more frequently, when rock salt is utilized. Rock salt is less expensive than evaporated salt and solar salt, but tank cleaning might take up a great deal of your energy and time.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
