<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
