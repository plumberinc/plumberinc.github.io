If your energy expenses are rising, a new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, permitting tough water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, moved to its brand-new place and positioned there.</p>
