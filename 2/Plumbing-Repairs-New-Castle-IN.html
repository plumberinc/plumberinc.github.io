This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>We concentrate on whole house re-pipes, new plumbing setups, and mainline water service replacement. Whether you require help with a minor repair, a remodel or a re-pipe, you can make sure that the work will be completed the very first time properly.
