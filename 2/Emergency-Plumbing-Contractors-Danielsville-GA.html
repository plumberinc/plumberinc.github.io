<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dosage, water solidity, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an influence on cleaning agent savings. The study consisted of tests that eliminated tough soils, in addition to assessing finding and filming. Researchers found that softened water uses practically 30% less detergent, but cleans up along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that detergent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
