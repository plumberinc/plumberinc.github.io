<p>When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
