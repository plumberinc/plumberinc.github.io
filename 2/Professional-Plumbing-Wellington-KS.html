<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Wellington KS</h3>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a significant factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in various instructions and can get huge triggering intrusion of the lines underground. Another truth is that tree roots try to find water sources and will follow the source leading them directly to sewer lines eventually growing right into them and triggering significant sewer line problems.</p>
