Keep in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate method. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
