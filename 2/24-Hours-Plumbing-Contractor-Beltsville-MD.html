<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Beltsville MD</h3>
<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it probably requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to go through. The pipes often make weird gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight area. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, leading to the odd sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
