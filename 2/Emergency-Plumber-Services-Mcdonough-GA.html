<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>

<p>Waste disposal unit clogged or broken? Whether you need repairs or replacement, we've got you covered in the Cincinnati area. Garbage disposals are designed to operate in one of 2 methods. Either through what's called a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a constant feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains simultaneously in your house, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in multiple areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Toilets are tough fixtures. However, there are times when you'll wish to replace a unappealing or outdated  model. Toilet installation can be an undesirable, messy job.
