<p>Making sure plumbing equipment such as sprinkler systems and fire pumps are isolated to their own respective networks is crucial in order to protect potable water safety. Having a plumbing inspection is pretty standard when buying a house or flat. If it's a rental I have not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be one of the most pricey repair tasks if overlooked. For example, if your water piping is galvanized pipe and pressure is a concern, you may need all of your water piping replaced. Once again, really costly.

<p>An authorization is also required to reconnect electric or gas service to a residence. If the energy has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months, reconnect authorizations are required. The authorization cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. An illustration must be sent that identifies the size and length of all piping if you are setting up water or gas piping. Include the Gas Piping Design template discovered listed below with your application.</p>
