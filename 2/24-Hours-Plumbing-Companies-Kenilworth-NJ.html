<p>It takes a great deal of planning to install a properly designed plumbing system. You don't wish to have actually awful, exposed piping in various locations of your house, even if particular components had to be installed as an afterthought.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested over the years. Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line going up to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap.
