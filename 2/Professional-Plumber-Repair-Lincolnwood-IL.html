<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Bad Smells - If nasty smells are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not appropriately draining water.

<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).

You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to make sure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
