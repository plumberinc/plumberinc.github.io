<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Mauldin SC 29662</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
