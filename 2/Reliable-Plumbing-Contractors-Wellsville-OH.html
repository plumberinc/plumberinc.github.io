<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Longstanding Clogs: Obstructions that continue after you've attempted to repair them require professional support. Continued efforts on your own can damage your lines, and you might have a more serious underlying problem than you understand. In addition, the longer you postpone to require professional assistance, the higher the likelihood that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
