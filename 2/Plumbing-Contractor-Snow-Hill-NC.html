<p>In order to guarantee the correct operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it must be evaluated and certified upon installation and a minimum of once a year afterwards if installed to secure form a health hazard situation.

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
