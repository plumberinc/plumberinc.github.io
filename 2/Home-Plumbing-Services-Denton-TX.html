This includes products labeled as organic", natural", and safe". This also consists of the safe" mosquito control items applied by sprinklers and misters. Keep in mind all these products are concentrated in the irrigation system water, so while they may be safe when dispersed into the air, they can be a lot more harmful when concentrated in the water in the pipes.</p>
<p>First and foremost, never ever plant anything up against your house, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the major line from your house to the city line.) If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have an idea of where your lateral lies. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to avoid. Your line will be easy to identify if you have a clean-out.</p>

This will permit us to see what concerns and problems you presently have, along with answer your questions. In many cases, an entire replumb is not always needed.</p>

<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
