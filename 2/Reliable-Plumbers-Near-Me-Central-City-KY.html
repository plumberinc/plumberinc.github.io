<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
