<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to ensure correct backflow prevention remains in place to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing tip notice 1 month prior to the annual test is due.</p>
