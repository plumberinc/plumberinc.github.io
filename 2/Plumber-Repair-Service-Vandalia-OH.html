<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in incorrect drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
