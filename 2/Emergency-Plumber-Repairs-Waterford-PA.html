<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or rusty that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
