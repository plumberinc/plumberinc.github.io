For gas hot water heater, a specific gas line needs to be installed and a viable source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not need any ventilation.

<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
