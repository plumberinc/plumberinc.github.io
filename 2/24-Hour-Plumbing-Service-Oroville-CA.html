However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
