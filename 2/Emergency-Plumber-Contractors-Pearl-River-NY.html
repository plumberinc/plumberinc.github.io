<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may require a backflow device. Often conditions on residential or commercial properties change that might require a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with ingredients or installing a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your company, they can cause financial losses and in some instances can stop your business entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be catastrophic. Even in a small office the issues caused by even small drain problems can cause major concerns.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
