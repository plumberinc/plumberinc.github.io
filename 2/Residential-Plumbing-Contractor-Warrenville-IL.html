<p>As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
