Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never ever had the sewer and drain lines checked. Some plumbers might get professional discount rates from merchants or kitchen and bath showrooms.

<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt.
