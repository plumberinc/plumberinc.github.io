<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
