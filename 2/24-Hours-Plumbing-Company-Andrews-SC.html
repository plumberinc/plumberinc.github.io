<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but hardly ever stop to consider. Another very important factor to call a professional for gas line repair in Richmond is the danger of fire it presents. When gas leaks go neglected longer than they should, the gas builds up and something as little as an oven burner can burst the entire house into flames. That's not all, a gas leak fire also triggers other gas-run home appliances to take off such as clothes dryer, water stoves, heaters, and fireplaces.</p>
