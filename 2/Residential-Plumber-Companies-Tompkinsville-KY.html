<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Tompkinsville KY</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
