Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can often get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, without any signs of leak, you can probably leave it in location. Chances are excellent that the mounting brackets on the brand-new system will fit simply great. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
