When you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your house, then that generally indicates that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple places and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.

Backflow preventers have springs, rubber seals and other moving parts that wear out gradually and it is necessary that they receivethe very same routine maintenance that your automobile or A/C system gets to guarantee your family's water is safe & clean.</p>
