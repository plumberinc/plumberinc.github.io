<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Henderson TN</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can also be tough to repair as they are normally situated behind the sink, in confined areas. The best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches take up excessive area and need a large swing angle, which may be challenging to obtain in small areas.</p>
