If you do not understand, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber locate the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or perhaps go into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also understand the areas to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to recognize.</p>
