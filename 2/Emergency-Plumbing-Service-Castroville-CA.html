<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>In addition to clogged drain repair, you can depend on Waldrop for leaking drain repair. Gradually, the material your drain is made from can begin to wear away, break down, and ultimately crack with normal use, leading to a leak. If there is water pooling under your sink or damp locations and signs of water damage, you might have a leaking drain. Not just do leaking drains cause water damage, they also result in a huge waste of water. A higher-than-normal water expense is often an indication that you have a plumbing leak somewhere.</p>
