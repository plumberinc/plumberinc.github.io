When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to go through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes frequently make unusual gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, leading to the weird sounds originating from your sink.</p>
