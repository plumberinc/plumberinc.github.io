<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are durable in the short-term, they degrade over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from corrosion and might put toxins into the freshwater supply. We advise replacing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your house. This might not need totally repiping the house, because newer products may have already been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you identify precisely what work needs to be done.</p>
