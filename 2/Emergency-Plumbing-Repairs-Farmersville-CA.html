<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our rigid trust certification requirements. A great rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs tough and pricey, implying a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the proper fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole fixture. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
