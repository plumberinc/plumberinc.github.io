<h3>Replace Water Heater in New Lenox Illinois</h2>
<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have actually accomplished a development in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology. SACr physically removes temporary firmness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are significant limitations of current softening innovations.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
