Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.

<p>They will normally stand behind their work with a warranty if you're working with a credible plumber in Utah. That means if something goes wrong later, you will have someone who can fix it with no included expenses.

When that happens, you will most likely need to call a plumber anyway to fix your mistakes, and possibilities are they will cost more and be harder than if you had simply called a professional in the first place.</p>
