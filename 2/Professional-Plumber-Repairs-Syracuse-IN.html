<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to remove chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and ends up in our streams and lakes. In houses with private wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the home's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
