<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of materials were used for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are vulnerable to many different kinds of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to compromise from corrosion and may position toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home.
