<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
<p>The simplest solution might seem to be simply overlooking the issue or utilizing a do it yourself chemical service. However, this is a temporary fix and may trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are delicate to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can wear away and erode your pipes, triggering significant leakages, fractures, and large damages.</p>
