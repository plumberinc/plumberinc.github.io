<p>The problem of leakage can be credited to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>

This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
