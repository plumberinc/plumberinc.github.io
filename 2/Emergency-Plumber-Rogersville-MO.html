Employment of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to constructing codes that require using fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink currently, it's likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by getting rid of the old drain.
