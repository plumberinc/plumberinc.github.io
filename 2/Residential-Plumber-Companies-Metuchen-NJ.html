<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
