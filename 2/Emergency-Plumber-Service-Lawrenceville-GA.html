<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
