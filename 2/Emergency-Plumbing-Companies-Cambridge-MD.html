<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
