<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
