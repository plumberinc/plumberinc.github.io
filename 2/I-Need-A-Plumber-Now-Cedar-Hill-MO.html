<p>It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage needs to likewise be provided.</p>
<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low.

For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
