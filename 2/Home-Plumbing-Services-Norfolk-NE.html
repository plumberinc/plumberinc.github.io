<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the option with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
