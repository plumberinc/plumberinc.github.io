<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers prevent backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow stays a legitimate health concern, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25.
