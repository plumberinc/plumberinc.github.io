<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open.
