<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>. The size of the population also impacts water need. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The typical per capita water use per day is higher in rural counties than metropolitan counties in all the climate regions, other than in the Central and Southeast areas"1 with rural areas having less effective supply of water systems2 mostly due to the relative lack of financial resources to upgrade and maintain their systems. So, the greater per capita consumption" of water in rural areas may consist of significant non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines.
