<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>This style water heater may make the most sense for you if you have a large bathtub or more that two restrooms. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to create more warm water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are quite special.
