<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one need to initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
