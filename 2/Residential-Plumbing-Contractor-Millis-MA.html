Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
