As hard water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger tough water stick to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>You hear water running or dripping in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water supply. The water flowing in reverse from a cross-connection may infect the drinking water supply. Yard irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis prevail cross-connection points.
