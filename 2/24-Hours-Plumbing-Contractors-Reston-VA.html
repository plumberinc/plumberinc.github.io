<p>Some pipe materials are cheaper than others; some are more susceptible and brittle to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and strains as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development. And these distinctions determine the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
