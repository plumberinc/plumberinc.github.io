<p>No other room in a house includes as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Search for quality products when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be quickly attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make certain it sets before testing the drain.</p>
