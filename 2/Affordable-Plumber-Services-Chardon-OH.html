Paper towels can rapidly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog even more down the drain. Womanly hygiene items should be dealt with in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be secured from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly must be used.
