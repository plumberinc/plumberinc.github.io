<p>In the 1990 â€² s, dry spell conditions determined water service providers to carry out water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

Constant blockages indicate your toilet no longer has the power required to successfully remove waste with each flush.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
