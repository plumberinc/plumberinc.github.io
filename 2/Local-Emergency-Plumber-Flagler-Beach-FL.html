When no other source of a leak can be determined, it is safe to assume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
