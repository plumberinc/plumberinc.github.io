<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>

I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

<p>Have actually utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, just like each person we've experienced with Plumb Crazy, were courteous, prompt, and extremely knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either little or large task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Overall time 1 hour. Bought retail. Get the plumbers putty at purchase. Cut off dedicated power 1st. I followed nice detailed instructions.
