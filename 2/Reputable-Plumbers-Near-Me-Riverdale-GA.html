<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, with no signs of leakage, you can most likely leave it in place. Chances are great that the installing brackets on the new system will fit just fine. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
