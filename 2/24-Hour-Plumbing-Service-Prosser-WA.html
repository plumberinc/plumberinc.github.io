<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
