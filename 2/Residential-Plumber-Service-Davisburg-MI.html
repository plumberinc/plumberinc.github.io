<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing major and frequent leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the less expensive and much better long-term service.</p>
