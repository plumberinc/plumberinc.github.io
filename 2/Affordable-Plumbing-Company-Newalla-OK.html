<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
