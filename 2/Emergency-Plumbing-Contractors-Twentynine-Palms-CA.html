It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
