<p>Sewer lines have one vital role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely costly alternative.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>

<p>The normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and does not have the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
