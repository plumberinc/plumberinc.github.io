<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from reversing in the opposite direction. You might be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, put simply, the very same thing, but without the zinc coating.

The elevation and location of the 100 year flood plain in relation to the center. A decreased pressure zone (RPZ) backflow preventer must normally be installed 1 foot above the 100 year flood plain elevation.</p>
