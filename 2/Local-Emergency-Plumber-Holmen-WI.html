<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Holmen WI</h3>
<p>Call us today for more information about our drain services. We're readily available for same-day appointments! Our team is standing by at (800) 259-7705. Roll plumber's putty between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and wrap it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
