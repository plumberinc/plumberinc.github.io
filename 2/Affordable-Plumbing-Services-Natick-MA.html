<p>For gas lines that must be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe need to be used that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the moisture out.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
