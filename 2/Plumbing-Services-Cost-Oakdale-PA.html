If your disposal is often making sounds that are abnormal for the machine, it might be in need of major repairs or it could be nearing the end of its life expectancy. Regular obstructions, even when you're barely washing down any food particles, might show a problem with the disposal. It is probably due to too much use over a long duration of time if there are leaks coming from your system. A lot of these leaks can be repaired, however if they become bigger and more regular, you need to think about total system replacement.</p>
<p>Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may also need a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing generally requires a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more details.
