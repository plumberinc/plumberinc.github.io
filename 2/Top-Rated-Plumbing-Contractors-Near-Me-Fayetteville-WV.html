When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can in fact cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
