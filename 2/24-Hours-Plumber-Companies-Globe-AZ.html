<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you have actually found the journey lever you desire eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to attach your flapper, ensure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
