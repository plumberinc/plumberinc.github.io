<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
