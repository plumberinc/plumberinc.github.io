<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

When the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not mean it's not working.

<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
