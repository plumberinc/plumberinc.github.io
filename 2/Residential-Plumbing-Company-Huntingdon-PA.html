<p>There are specific plumbers who concentrate on plumbing connected with home improvement and new construction.

<p>If your pipes are older than these guidelines, it does not always indicate they need to be changed. Well-kept pipes may last longer, and poorly maintained ones or those in areas with hard water (implying it has high mineral material), might stop working earlier, says Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life expectancy estimates.</p>
<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will come from new construction and the need to maintain and repair plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt changes to constructing codes that require using fire suppression systems.

If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in location-- start by removing the old drain. A lot of drains are attached to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
