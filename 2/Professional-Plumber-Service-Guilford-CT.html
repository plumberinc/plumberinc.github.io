<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Guilford CT</h3>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another common leak-prone area. These can likewise be tough to repair as they are normally situated behind the sink, in confined areas. The very best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up too much space and need a large swing angle, which might be hard to acquire in little areas.</p>
