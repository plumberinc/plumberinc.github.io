<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
