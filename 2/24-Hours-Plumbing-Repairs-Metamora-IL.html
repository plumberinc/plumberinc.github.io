Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
