<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Montrose MI 48457?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
