<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the same thing, however without the zinc finish. The zinc finish on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with moisture. While it does its task quite well, over time, it still does rust. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
