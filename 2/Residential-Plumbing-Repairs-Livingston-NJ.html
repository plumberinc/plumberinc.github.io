<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Livingston NJ</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
