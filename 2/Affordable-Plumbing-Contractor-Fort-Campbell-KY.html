<p>We're replacing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a lp water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As an outcome, we recommend changing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system.
