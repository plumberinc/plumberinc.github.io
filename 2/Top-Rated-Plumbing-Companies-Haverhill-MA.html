<p>If you're dealing with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless home appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Hard water is not an issue that will disappear on its own and the costs sustained by difficult water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, appliances will inevitably fail sooner than their anticipated life expectancy.
