<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Marion KY</h3>
<p>A recently installed hot water heater should not produce weird noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things intensify drastically for families with a high demand for hot water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
