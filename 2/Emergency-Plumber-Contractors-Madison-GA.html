Continuous feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can sometimes get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
