<p>In fact, reverse flow testing created to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow stays a legitimate health concern, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are appropriately checked by certified personnel.</p>
<p>If you have your water checked, the report will use one or both of these systems to tell you how tough your water is. Because the level of calcium carbonate suggests little to water consumers, water professionals have categorized levels of hardness. Table 1 shows these categories.

Generally, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
