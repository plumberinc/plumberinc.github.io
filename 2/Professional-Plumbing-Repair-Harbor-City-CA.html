<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or broken, it could wreak unwanted issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) runs from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
