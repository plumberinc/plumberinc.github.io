<p>If you observe an odor or unpleasant odor originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about investing in a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are easy and widely available to install, costing around $30 in the house enhancement or hardware stores. Turn off the water system to your house at the main line.

<p>If you're dealing with a reliable plumber in Utah, they will usually guarantee their work with an assurance. That indicates if something fails later on, you will have somebody who can fix it without any added costs. The alternative do-it-yourself (Do It Yourself) method offers no such assurances, and in most cases unless you know a lot about plumbing, there's a pretty significant risk that you might do more damage.
