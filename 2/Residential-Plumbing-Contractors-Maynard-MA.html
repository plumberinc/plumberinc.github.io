<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Company in Maynard</h2>

<p>Your sewer line is among the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or damaged, it might wreak undesirable problems on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
